formula


Definition
!@#$%
In mathematics, a formula is a fact, rule, or principle that is expressed in terms of mathematical symbols. Examples of formulas include equations, equalities, identities, inequalities, and asymptotic expressions.
The term "formula" is also commonly used in the theory of logic to mean sentential formula (also called a propositional formula), i.e., a formula in propositional calculus.
The correct Latin plural form of formula is "formulae, " although the less pretentious-sounding "formulas" is more commonly used.

Definition
!@#$%
The centroid is center of mass of a two-dimensional planar lamina or a three-dimensional solid. The mass of a lamina with surface density function σ(x, y) is
M = integral integral σ(x, y) dA, and the coordinates of the centroid (also called the center of gravity) are
x^_ | = | ( integral integral xσ(x, y) dA)/M
y^_ | = | ( integral integral yσ(x, y) dA)/M.
The centroid of a lamina is the point on which it would balance when placed on a needle. The centroid of a solid is the point on which the solid would "balance."

Newton's forward difference formula is a finite difference identity giving an interpolated value between tabulated points {f_p} in terms of the first value f_0 and the powers of the forward difference Δ. For a element [0, 1], the formula states
f_a = f_0 + aΔ + 1/(2!) a(a - 1) Δ^2 + 1/(3!) a(a - 1)(a - 2) Δ^3 + ....

lattice


Definition
!@#$%
An algebra 〈L;⋀, ⋁〉 is called a lattice if L is a nonempty set, ⋀ and ⋁ are binary operations on L, both ⋀ and ⋁ are idempotent, commutative, and associative, and they satisfy the absorption law. The study of lattices is called lattice theory.
Note that this type of lattice is distinct from the regular array of points known as a point lattice (or informally as a mesh or grid). While every point lattice is a lattice under the ordering inherited from the plane, many lattices are not point lattices.
Lattices offer a natural way to formalize and study the ordering of objects using a general concept known as the partially ordered set.
