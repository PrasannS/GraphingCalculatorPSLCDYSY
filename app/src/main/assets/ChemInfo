Boyle&#8217;s Law, an ideal gas law which states that the volume of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its absolute pressure <span style="background-color: #f5f6f5;">at a constant temperature. The law applies only to ideal gases which allow only pressure and volume to change.

In other words, the product of pressure and volume is constant for a fixed mass of ideal gas at fixed temperature.

                                          P<sub>1</sub> X V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub> X V<sub>2</sub>

The other way to express Boyle’s Law is as follows

Where

Example 1 
Neon (Ne) sample occupies 4L at a pressure of 5 x 104 Pa and 273K temperature. Calculate the volume of the sample at STP?

Solution

Initial conditions are 
P1 = 5 x 10-4Pa and V1 = 4L

Final conditions are 
P2 = 101325 Pa and V2 = ?

We have an equation
P1 x V1 = P2 x V2
V2 = P1V1/P2
V2 = (5 x 104 Pa) (4L) / 1.01325 x 105 Pa
      = 2 x 10 5 / 1.01325 x 105 L

Hence, V2 = 1.97 L


Example 2
A gaseous nitrogen sample in a 65L air bag has a pressure of 745 mm Hg. If this sample is transferred into a 25 L bag at same temperature, what is the pressure of the gas in 25L bag?

Solution

Initial conditions
P1 = 745 mm of Hg and V1 = 65L

Final conditions
V2 = 25L and P2 =?

We have an equation

P1V1 = P2V2

Put the above values in this equation
P2 = P1V1/V2
P2 = 745 mm of Hg x 65L / 25L

Therefore P2 = 1940 mm Hg

Energy equivalent to mass defect is termed as binding energy. A nucleus is like an inflexible spherical ball molded by getting together a huge amount of miniature spherical balls in the nucleons form. Something is required to bound the nucleons collected. It is that something which assists as the glue. Every nucleon has to donate some of its mass, to deliver the energy resulting in a mass defect.
&#8220;More binding energy means more strong binding as energy is a measure of the strength of the bondage.&#8221;

Atomic Mass Formula
Atomic mass is the total of the masses of the electrons, neutrons, and protons in an atom, or in a group of atoms, the average mass. When compared to protons or neutrons electrons have so much less mass that they don&#8217;t influence the calculation. Thus, the total of the masses of neutrons and protons is the atomic mass.

Atomic mass = Number of protons + number of neutrons + number of electrons

There are three methods to know the atomic mass, depending on one’s circumstances.
1) Use the Periodic Table! 
If it&#8217;s one’s first encounter with chemistry, their tutor will want them to study how to make use of the periodic table to find the atomic weight of an element. This digit is typically written underneath an element&#8217;s representation. Search for a decimal number, which is the weighted average of the atomic masses of every natural isotope of an element.
2) Sum of Protons and Neutrons 
Add up the mass of neutrons and protons to compute the atomic mass of a single atom of an element.

3) For All Atoms of an Element &#8211; Weighted Average
The weighted average of every element&#8217;s isotopes grounded on their abundance in nature is the atomic weight of an element. It is simple to compute the atomic mass of any element with these tips.
Usually, in these questions, one is provided with a list of isotopes with their natural abundance and their mass either as percent value or a decimal. Multiply each isotope&#8217;s abundance by its mass. If someone&#8217;s abundance is a percent, they should divide their solution by 100. Add these values up. The solution is the whole atomic weight or atomic mass of the selected element.
The atomic mass unit can be associated to other units of mass using the conversion factor
                                          1u = 1.66054 X 10-24g











Problem 1: Find the mass number of an element whose atomic number is 16 and the number of neutrons in its atom is 19.
Solution:
Atomic number or number of protons = 16
Number of Neutrons = 19
Mass number (A) = Number of neutrons + Number of protons
Mass number (A) = 19 + 16
Mass number (A) = 35

Problem 2: What is the atomic weight of an element that consists of two isotopes? Isotope A has an abundance of 75.00 percent, and its mass is 14.000 units. The Isotope B has a mass of 15.000 atomic mass units and an abundance of 25.00 percent.
Solution:
The word percentage abundance points out how many atoms of an isotope are made up of 100 atoms of the element. In this instance, 100 atoms of the element would comprise 75 atoms of isotope A and 25 atoms of isotope B.
For computing the atomic weight of the element, we multiply the mass of individual isotopes by the decimal equivalent of their percentage abundance and then add the results.
Atomic mass = (14.000u x 0.7500) + (15.000u x 0.2500)
Atomic mass = 14.25u

In order to start a reaction, molecule requires energy. This can be understood by a simple example &#8211;  molecules need some kinetic energy or velocity to collide with other molecules to start a reaction. No reaction will take place, if collision don’t happen, or molecules don’t have enough kinetic energy. The energy needs to initiate the reaction is known as Activation energy.
“Activation Energy is the minimum amount of energy that is needed to start a chemical reaction.”

Where
k = rate constant
A = frequency factor
Ea = activation energy

Question 1: The rate constant for the reaction
2N2O5(g) →→ 4NO2(g) + O2(g) is 5.0 ×× 10-4S-1. Frequency factor is 2.812 ×× 1013S-1. Find the activation energy of the reaction at 45oC.

Question 2: The rate of a reaction increases when the temperature changes from 293 to 313K. Find the energy of activation of the reaction assuming that it does not change with temperature.
Solution:
The T1and T2 are 293K and 313K
Rearrange the following equation to get Ea.

uRLStringLine class="alignnone" title="\large log\frac{K_{2}}{K_{1}}= -\frac{E_{_{a}}}{2.303 R}\left ( \frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{T_{1}T_{2}} \right )" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&amp;space;\large&amp;space;log\frac{K_{2}}{K_{1}}=&amp;space;-\frac{E_{_{a}}}{2.303&amp;space;R}\left&amp;space;(&amp;space;\frac{T_{2}-T_{1}}{T_{1}T_{2}}&amp;space;\right&amp;space;)" alt="Activation_Energy" width="302" height="58" />

So that Ea = 2.303R [T1T2T2−T1T1T2T2−T1 ×× logK2K1K2K1]
T1T2T2−T1T1T2T2−T1 = 4585.45K
logK2K1K2K1 = log4141 = log4 = 0.6021
Ea = 2.303 ×× 8.314JK-1mol-1 ×× 4585.45K ×× 0.6021
Ea = 52848 Jmol-1

What is Bond order?
The bond order shows the number of chemical bonds present between a pair of atoms. For instance, the bond order of diatomic nitrogen N≡N is 3 and bond order between the carbon atoms in H-H≡C-H is also three. The bond order describes the stability of the bond.The molecular orbital provides an easy understanding of the concept of the bond order of a chemical bond. It quantifies the degree of covalent bonds between the atoms.

 How to calculate Bond order?
The Bond Order Formula can be defined as half of the difference between the number of electrons in bonding orbitals and antibonding orbitals.  
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter" title="\large Bond order=\frac{1}{2}\left [ N_{b}-N_{a} \right ]" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&amp;space;\large&amp;space;Bond&amp;space;order=\frac{1}{2}\left&amp;space;[&amp;space;N_{b}-N_{a}&amp;space;\right&amp;space;]" width="258" height="50" />
Where,
Nb is the number of bonding electrons
Na is the number of antibonding electrons 

Example 1
Determine the bond order of C2 molecule.
Solution
Step 1. Write the electronic configuration of C2 molecule.
Electronic configuration of C2
= (σ1s)2 (σ*1s)2(σ2s)2(σ*2s)(π2px2 π2py2)

Step 2. From the above electronic configuration, put the values in the formula
Bond order = Nb &#8211; Na / 2

        = 6 &#8211; 2 / 2 
   
                    = 2 
The double bond in C2 consists of both π bonds due to the presence of four electrons in two π molecular orbitals. Therefore, the stability of C2 is very less. 

Example 2
Determine the bond order of hydrogen molecule (H2).

Solution
Step 1. Write the electronic configuration of Hydrogen atom

The electronic configuration of hydrogen is (σ1s)2
Step 2. Put the values from the above electronic configuration in the bond order formula, we get
Bond order = 2 – 0 / 2
Therefore, bond order = 1
It means single covalent bond exist in H2 molecule, and diamagnetic since there is no unpaired electron.

Ptotal is the total pressure of a gaseous mixture and
P1, P2, P3 are the partial pressures of the individual gases. 
Example 1
Determine the partial pressure of H2 at 20oC when the vapour pressure of water is 17.5torr.  If the total pressure of the gas is 750 torr.

Solution
The Given values are
Ptotal = 750 torr
PH20 = 17.5torr
PH2 =? 
By applying Dalton&#8217;s Formula, we get
Ptotal =PH20 + PH2 
750 torr = 17.5torr + PH2
PH2 = 732 torr

Example 2
Three gases H2, N2 and Ar, are mixed in a container of 500L. The pressure of Ar is 255 torr; N2 is 228 torr and H2 is 752 torr. Calculate the total pressure in the container.

Solution
We know that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressure of each gas.
Add the three partial pressures
Ptotal = 255 torr + 228 torr + 752 torr
Ptotal =1235 torr

Some thermodynamic functions cannot be calculated straightforwardly. One needs to be able to present these quantities regarding others that can be experimentally determined.

Solved Examples
Problem 1: Calculate how much heat is either added or removed from the system when 100kJ of work is done on a closed system during a process and the total energy of the system increases by 55.0kJ.?
Answer:
By the energy conservation principle, a gross energy transfer to system effects in an equivalent increase of internal energy stockpiled in the system. This may be articulated as
Q = DeltaE + W
This equation is typical statement of first law. It says that in any alteration of state the heat supplied to a system is equal to the work finished by the system plus the upsurge of internal energy in the system.
Bearing in mind the work is done on a system as positive
Q + (+100.0) = +55.0
Q = +55.0 – 100.0
Q = -45.0kJ
From the result owing to the negative sign 45.0kJ of energy in heat form is removed from the system all through the procedure.
Problem 2: For a pound of Freon 12 refrigerant calculate the work done during compression. The refrigerant is at 20 psia and 30oF and is compressed to 140 psia and 150oF during a compression stroke.
Answer:
From the table of thermodynamic properties for refrigerent 12 the unique and concluding specific volumes are 2.0884 and 0.33350 cu ft/lb respectively. For the procedure

frac14020 = left(frac2.08840.33350right)2
7 = (6.262)n
n = 1.0607
The work done in compression =
W = fracP2V2–P1V11−n

The variations together with the heat content of the materials which react, result in enthalpy(H) the accurate word for heat content. Typically, this variation in the heat content or enthalpy is displayed by an alteration in temperature.There is an alteration in the heat of the reaction, during the reaction. The enthalpy change for the reaction is represented by DeltaH (sometimes called the heat of reaction). The enthalpy of products is H2 and is less than the heat content of reactants H1.
Enthalpy Formula is denoted as
Enthaply Change = Heat of the Reaction

As the enthalpy change amplifies itself as heat, the statement “heat of reaction” is frequently made use of in place of enthalpy change of reaction. The key relation between enthalpy change and heat of reaction.The enthalpy of reaction equals the heat of reaction at constant pressure.

Solved Examples

Problem 1: For the thermite reaction compute the enthalpies of formation.
2Al + Fe2O3 àAl2O3 + 2Fe
This reaction occurs when a mixture of powders aluminium and iron(III) oxide is ignited with a magnesium fuse.
Given
DeltaH for Fe2O3 = -826kJ/mol
DeltaH for Al2O3 = -1676 kJ/mol
DeltaH for Al = DeltaDeltaH for Fe = 0
Solution:
We use the equation.
Enthalpy Formula
DeltaH (reaction) = DeltaDeltaH for Al2O3 – DeltaDeltaH for Fe2O3
DeltaH (reaction) = -1676kJ – (-826kJ)
DeltaH (reaction) = -850kj
 
Problem 2: For a combustion reaction.
2C8H18 + 25CO2 à 16CO2 + 18H2O
What is the variation in enthalpy of the reaction?
Given
DeltaH for CO2 = -394kJ
DeltaH for H2O = -286kJ
DeltaH for C8H18 = -269kJ
Solution:
DeltaH = 16 times DeltaH for CO2 + 18 times DeltaH for H2O – 2 times DeltaH for C8H18
DeltaH = 16 times (-394kJ) + 18 times (-286kJ) – 2 times (-269kJ)
DeltaH = -1.09 times 104kJ

Dilution refers to drop in the pH of a chemical which can be a gas, vapor or solution. It involves the process of decreasing the concentration of a solute in the solution normally by mixing with solvent. To dilute a solution add more solvent without the addition of more solute. Mix the resulting solution thoroughly to ensure that all parts of the solution are even. 
For example, if 10 grams of salt is dissolved in 1 liter of water, it has a particular salt concentration. By adding 1 liter of water to this solution, the salt concentration is reduced. The dilute solution still has 10 grams of salt.

To prepare a fixed amount of dilute solution, we have a formula
C1V1 = C2V2 
Where,
V1 denotes the Volume of stock solution needed to make the new solution
C1 = Concentration of stock solution
V2 is the final volume of the solution. 
Example 1
A chemist needs 1.5M hydrochloric acid  for a reaction. The solution available is 6M of HCl. What is the volume of 6M HCl to be diluted to obtain 5L of 1.5M HCl?
Solution
Initial concentration of HCl is 6M
Final concentration of HCl is 1.5M
Final volume of solution is 5L
The initial volume needs to be found. 
Substituting the values, we get
Vi = 1.5 x 5.0 / 6
= 1.3 L

Example 2
If 500mL of 15% of X solution of methyl salicylate in alcohol is diluted to 1500mL, find the percentage of X.

According to the Gay Lussac’s Law, at constant volume, the pressure of a fixed mass of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. 
\(P \alpha T\)
Since P and T vary directly, we can equate them by making use of a constant k.
\(\frac{P}{T}=constant =k\)
The value of k depends on the pressure of the gas, its amount and also on the unit of volume V.
\(\frac{P}{T} &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; (1)
Let P1 and T1 be the initial pressure and temperature of an ideal gas. We can write equation 1 as:
\(\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}=K\)&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; (2)
If the temperature is changed to a new value, let’s say T2, and then the pressure will change to P2. Then we get,
\(\frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}=K\) &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; (3)
Equating (2) and (3), we get

\(\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}=k\)

<b>Solution:</b> We have the variables,

Final Pressure P2 = 1.5 atm 
Final Temperature T2 =250K  
Initial Temperature T1 =?       
Applying Gay Lussac’s law we get,
\(T_{1}=\frac{P_{1}T_{2}}{P_{2}}\)
T1= (1 x 250) / 1.5 = 166.6 K
<b>Question 2:</b> A gas container is at a <a href="https://byjus.com/physics/temperature/" target="_blank">temperature </a>of 150K and a pressure of 1520 torr. The gas is heated to 300K. Find the new pressure in the unit of atm.
<b>Solution:</b> Given,
Initial Pressure P1= 1520 torr
Final Pressure P2 = ?
Initial Temperature T1 = 150
Final Temperature T2 = 300
For converting pressure in torr to atm, we use the relation:
1 atm = 760 torr
∴ 1520720 =   2 atm
Using Gay Lussac’s Law Formula, 
\(P_{1}T_{2}=P_{2}T_{1}\)
\(P_{2}=\frac{P_{1}T_{2}}{T_{1}}\)
\(P_{2}=\frac{2\times 300}{150}=4\; atm\)

Provides the association amongst amount and volume when temperature and pressure are held at standard. The amount is measured in moles, always remember that. Similarly, the container holding the gas is flexible in some way and can expand or contract because the volume is one of the variables.

If the amount of gas in a container is amplified, the volume upsurges.
If the quantity of gas in a container is reduced, the volume declines.

Why?
Let&#8217;s assume that the quantity is greater than before. This means that there are numerous gas molecules, and this will intensify the number of impacts on the vessels walls. This can be comprehended as the gas pressure inside the vessel will grow (instantaneously), reaching a pressure greater than on the exterior of the walls. Thus, the walls move outwards. As there is added wall space, and the pressure will return to its original value as the impacts will lessen.
The scientific form of Avogadro&#8217;s Law is:           
                                  V ÷ n = k
This means that the volume amount fraction will always be the same value if the pressure and temperature remain constant.

Let V1 and n1 be a volume amount pair of data at the commencement of an research. If the amount is transformed to a different value called n2, then the volume will b altered to V2.
As we are aware that  V1 ÷ n1 = k
And we are acquainted with: V2 ÷ n2 = k
Meanwhile as k = k, we can determine that V1 ÷ n1 = V2 ÷ n2.
This equation of V1 ÷ n1 = V2 ÷ n2 will be very useful in cracking Avogadro&#8217;s Law problems. Here is the Law articulated in fractional form:

The boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid starts to boil and transforms to vapor. The liquid begins to boil at a particular temperature when its vapor pressure becomes equal to atmospheric pressure. The presence of solute lowers the vapor pressure and makes it necessary to heat at a higher temperature to boil the solution. The boiling point of water (universal solvent) is known to be 100oC, which states that water starts to turn to a vapor state, and its vapor pressure becomes equal to atmospheric pressure at 100oC.

The boiling point elevation is directly proportional to the molality of the solute particles in the solution.
∆Tb = Kbm
∆Tb = Amount by which the boiling point is elevated.
 Kb = molal boiling-point elevation constant which is solvent dependent.
 m =molality (moles of solute particles per kg of solution)
Boiling point of solution is given by
Boiling point  =  boiling point of the solvent + ∆Tb

Solution
The parameters given are
 m = 0.015 and Kb = 0.5oC/m
Water is the solvent, therefore 
Tsolvent = 70oC
The boiling point formula is given by
Tsolution = Tsolvent +∆T
∆T = Kbm
∆T = 0.5 x 0.015 = 0.0075oC

Solution
The given parameters are,
M = 0.0285m and Kb = 0.612oC/m
Since water is solvent, 
Tsolvent = 100oC
Boiling point formula is
Tsolution = Tsolvent + ∆T
∆T = Kbm 
∆T = 0.612 x 0.0285 = 0.017442

Charles’ law is one of the gas laws which explains the relationship between volume and temperature of a gas. It states that when pressure is held constant, the volume of a fixed amount of dry gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. When two measurements are in direct proportion then any change made in one of them affects the other through direct variation. Charles’ Law is expressed by the equation:
<b>\(V\alpha T\)</b>
<b>Or</b>
<b> \(\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}\)</b>
Where,
Jacques Charles, a French scientist, in 1787, discovered that keeping the pressure constant, the volume of a gas varies on changing its temperature. Later, Joseph Gay-Lussac, in 1802, modified and generalized the concept as Charles’s law. At very high temperatures and low pressures, gases obey Charles’ law.
<b>Derivation:</b>
Charles’ Law states that at a constant pressure, the volume of a fixed mass of a dry gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. We can represent this using the following equation:
<b>\(V\alpha T\)</b>
Since V and T vary directly, we can equate them by making use of a constant k.
\(\frac{V}{T}=constant=k\)
The value of k depends on the pressure of the gas, the amount of the gas and also on the unit of the volume.
VT = k &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; (I)
Let V1 and T1 be the initial volume and temperature of an ideal gas. We can write equation I as:
\(\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=k\) &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; (II)
Let’s change the temperature of the gas to T2. Consequently, its volume changes to V2. So we can write,
\(\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}=k\) &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; (III)
Equating equations (II) and (III),
\(\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}=k\)
Hence, we can generalize the formula and write it as:
\(\frac{(V_{1})}{(T_{1})}=\frac{(V_{2})}{(T_{2})}\)
Or
<b>\(V_{1}T_{2}=V_{2}T_{1}\)</b>
You know that on heating up a fixed mass of gas, that is, increasing the temperature, the volume also increases. Similarly, on cooling, the volume of the gas decreases. At 0 degree centigrade, the volume of the gas increases 1/273 of its original volume for a unit degree increase in temperature.
<b>It is to be noted here that the unit Kelvin is preferred for solving problems related to Charles’ Law, and not Celsius. </b>Kelvin (T) is also known as the Absolute temperature scale. For converting a temperature to Kelvin scale, you add 273 to the temperature in the centigrade/Celsius scale.
<b>Charles’ Law in Real Life:</b>
Charles’ law has a wide range of applications in our daily life. Some of the common examples are given below:


<b>Solved Examples:</b>

<b>Solution: </b>Given,
V1= 400 cm³ 
Here the pressure is constant and only the temperature is changed. 
Using Charles Law,
\(\frac{(V_{1})}{(T_{1})}=\frac{(V_{2})}{(T_{2})}\)
\(\frac{400}{273}=\frac{V_{2}}{353}\)
\(V_{2}=\frac{400\times 353}{273}\)
\(V_{2}=517.21cm^{3}\)
1 cubic centimeter = 0.001 litre =1 x 10-3 litre
∴ 517.21 cubic centimeter = 517.21 x 10-3 = 0.517 litres

<b>Solution: </b>Given,
V1=? 
T2= 100 K
Using Charles Law,
\(\frac{(V_{1})}{(T_{1})}=\frac{(V_{2})}{(T_{2})}\)
\(\frac{(V_{1})}{(150)}=\frac{(6)}{(100)}\)
\(V_{1}=\frac{6\times 150}{100}\)

Ionic compounds are neutral compounds made up of positive cations and negative anions.Every ionic compound has discrete ionic units with a specific charge. An Ionic compound always contains equal amount of positive and negative charge. The chemical formula of an ionic compound represents its ionic units and cation to anion ratio.
Chemical formulas of ionic compounds are not complicated to write. Write the cation symbol followed by anion symbol. Then, find the lowest multiple of the ions to make the compound neutral.Ionic compounds consist of positively and negatively charged ions, but the overall compound and its formula are electrically neutral. In other words,
   Total Positive charge of cation = Total Negative charge of anion
Ionic compounds usually consist of a combination of metals and nonmetals.These are the guidelines to ensure uniformity in writing the ionic compound formula.
Example 1
Identify which of the following substance are ionic.
uRLStringLine title="SrCl_{2}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?SrCl_{2}" alt="" />
uRLStringLine title="CCl_{4}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CCl_{4}" alt="" />
Solution
To determine the ionic compound, look for Group 1 or Group 2 metals or Polyatomic ions.
In uRLStringLine title="SrCl_{2}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?SrCl_{2}" alt="" />, the presence of strontium which is a Group 2 metal shows that strontium chloride is an ionic compound.  
In uRLStringLine title="CCl_{4}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CCl_{4}" alt="" />, Chlorine exists as a -1 anion but there are no cation in carbon tetrachloride, therefore uRLStringLine title="CCl_{4}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CCl_{4}" alt="" /> is not ionic. 
Example 2
Determine the chemical formula of the ionic compound Calcium Chloride.
Solution
The names of cations and anions identify the chemical formulas along with changes of each ion.The charges indicate the ion ratio that needs to appear in the chemical formula.
Calcium chloride contains Ca+ of Group 2 and Cl- of Group 17. That&#8217;s the reason there must be two anions for every cation. Therefore, the chemical formula of calcium chloride is uRLStringLine title="CaCl_{2}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CaCl_{2}" alt="" />

The mole is a counting unit to specify the number of atoms, molecules, ions or formula units in a particular chemical compound. It is similar to other counting units like a pair (2) and a dozen (12). One mole of a compound contains Avogadro’s number (6.022 x 1023) of molecules or formula units. The molar mass of a compound defines the mass of 1 mole of that particular substance and number of grams per mole of a compound.  In other words, molar mass is the total mass of all the atoms in grams that make a mole of a particular molecule. Therefore, the units of molar mass are grams/mole.

How to find the molar mass of a compound?

Step 1. Make use of the chemical formula to determine the number of atoms of each element in the compound.
Step 2. Multiply the atomic weight of each element with its number of atoms present in the compound.
Step 3. Add up all and assign unit as grams/mole.  

Example. 1  What is the molar mass of sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 ?
Solution Since sodium carbonate contains two atoms sodium, one atom of carbon and three atoms of oxygen. The molecular weight would be
Na : 2 x 23.0 =  46
C : 1 x 12.0 = 12
O : 3 x 16 = 48
When we add up the total values i.e, 46 + 12 + 48 = 106
Therefore, the molar mass of Na2CO3 is 106 g/mole.
You can round up the atomic weights and molar mass nearest to 0.1 g/mole. But never let

Example 2.Identify the molar mass of calcium nitrate, Ca(NO3)2 ?
Solution: Since calcium nitrate contains one atom of calcium, two atoms of nitrogen and six atoms of oxygen.
Ca: 1 x 40.1 = 40.1
N: 2 x 14.0 = 28
O: 6 x 16.0 = 96
If we add all, 40.1 + 14 + 16 = 164.1
Therefore, molar mass of Ca(NO3)2 is 164.1 g/mol.

Note that the subscript two after the parentheses specifies that there are 2 nitrate ions (NO3-). Multiply the number of atoms with the subscripts outside the parenthesis.  Subscripts outside the ( ) affect only the atoms inside the ( ) and not the Ca ion.

What is Mass percent?
The Mass percent is a way of expressing a concentration or describing the component in a particular mixture. The solution composition can be described in mass percentage which shows the mass of solute present in a given mass of solution.The quantity of solute is expressed in mass or by moles. For a solution, the mass percent is described as the grams of solute per grams of solution, multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
Mass percent formula
The Mass percent formula is expressed as solving for the molar mass also for the mass of each element in 1 mole of the compound. You can determine the mass percentage of each element with these masses.

Example 1
Solution
The interpretation of mass/mass percent number shows that 5g of CaCl2 is used to prepare 100g of solution.
Example 2
Determine how many grams of sugar is present in 1.500g pf 1.50% solution of sugar in water.
Solution
Since mass percentage gives the mass of sugar in 100g of solution.
Hence, 22.5g sugar is present in 1.500g of 1.50% solution.

The Net ionic equation provides the information of ions that exists in aqueous medium. Salts get dissolved in polar solvents like water and present as cations and anions in dissolved state. The net ionic equation indicates the chemical species that undergo a chemical change. The ions that appear on both sides of the equation remain constant and therefore considered to be spectator ions. Many equations have been encountered, most of them have been condensed equations where in all the reactants and products are indicated as electrically neutral molecules and compounds.

Whenever the liquid evaporates, the gaseous molecules formed will escape in the air. But, If the liquid is kept in a closed container, the gaseous molecules will not escape in the air but will remain above the liquid. Those evaporated particles will create a pressure above the liquid, which is then known as the vapour pressure. 

What is Vapour Pressure Formula?
A solution is created when a solid gets dissolved into the liquid. The vapour pressure formed from this solution is lowered by the addition of the solute. Here comes the Vapour pressure formula which explains how the vapour pressure of a liquid gets changed by the addition of a solute.
              P <sub>solution</sub> = X <sub>solvent</sub>  x   P^o<sub> solvent </sub><sub> </sub>      

X<sub> solvent</sub> = the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution
P <sub>solution</sub> = the vapor pressure of the solution
P°<sub>solvent</sub> = the vapor pressure of the solvent

Examples of vapour pressure formula

from which simpler gas laws such as Amonton&#8217;s, Avogadro&#8217;s, Charles&#8217;s and Boyle&#8217;s law were derived.
One must highlight that this gas law is based on ideal situation. As chemists, instructors, and scholars, we from time to time need to comprehend the concepts in advance before we can use them, and to suppose, unaffected by real world conditions, the gases are in an ideal state; it will help us better comprehend the behavior the gases. Gas&#8217; behavior must follow the Kinetic-Molecular Theory to be ideal, whereas the Non-Ideal Gases will deviate from this theory due to real world situations.

Problem 1: What is the temperature of One mole of CH4 gas that occupies 20.0L at 1.00atm pressure in Kelvin?
Solution:

T = fracPVn times frac1R
T = frac[1.00atm][20.0L]1.00mol times fracmol.K0.0821L.atm
T = 244K
Remember that under these conditions we computed the temperature for 1.00 mol of CH4 gas. The solution would be similar for 1.00 mol of NH3, N2, CO2 or any other gas underneath these settings.

Problem 2: What is the gas pressure within a cylinder if there is 5.0g of CO2 gas in a 10 L cylinder at 25oC inside it.
Solution:
The measure of CO2 has been presented in grams but to apply the ideal gas law, we must convert the quantity into moles. For that reason, one must initially convert grams of CO2 to moles, and then use this value in the ideal gas law.
To convert into moles from grams we use 1 mol CO2 = 44g as the conversion factor.
5.0g CO2 times frac1molCO244gCO2 = 0.11 mol CO2
To solve for the pressure of the gas, we now use this value in the ideal gas equation.

In any chemical reaction, the limiting reactant(or reagent) is a substance which is totally consumed when the chemical reaction is complete. This reagent limits the quantity of the product produced and the reaction cannot continue without it. In a precipitation reaction, the incomplete precipitation gives the idea of limiting reagent. In dissolution reaction, the clear saturated or unsaturated solution gives the limiting reactant. In case of gaseous reaction, the limiting reagent is found by analyzing the mixture of gases that are formed. 
The procedure to determine the limiting reagent is as follows
Balance the chemical equation if not balanced.
Find out the number of moles of every reactant in the reaction.
Calculate the amount of products that can be produced from the complete reaction.
Determine which reactant would produce the minimum quantity of product, and that is the        limiting reagent.

2.3 g of sodium metal = 2.3 / 23 = 0.1 mole
It requires 1 x 0.1/2 = 0.05 moles of chlorine
1 mole of chlorine gas = 22.4 L at STP
Therefore, 3 L = 3/22.4 = 0.1339 moles
Hence, Sodium metal is the limiting reactant.
The amount of Cl2 in excess is 0.1339 – 0.05 moles
= 0.0839 moles occupy 0.0839 x 22.4 / 1

S = 32.06
O = 16
Therefore, the molecular mass of H2SO4 is

Hence, one mole of H2SO4 weights 98.08 grams. 
Since you need to find for 3.60 mol of H2SO4,
3.60    mol x 98.08 g/mol 
= 353 g of H2SO4

Solution = 300mL = 0.300L
Normality = 0.1381 x 1 eq/mol 0.300 L 
Therefore Normality = 0.460 N
<b>Solution</b>
Equivalent solute = 0.248mol x 2eq/mol
Solution = 250 mL = 0.250L

The force exerted by the substance per unit area on another substance is known as pressure. The pressure of gas is the force exerted by the gas on the walls of its container.The gas molecules move randomly along the given volume. During this movement, they collide with the surface and also with each other. The impact of every individual gas molecule is too small and difficult to visualize. But the impact of all the gas molecules considered together constitutes the gas pressure. Greater the number of collisions, greater would be the pressure.

The Gas pressure formula is given as,
                          uRLStringLine class="alignleft" title="P=\frac{F}{A}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P=\frac{F}{A}" alt="" />

Where,
V = volume,  
n = number of moles,
R = Gas constant,
T = temperature.
The SI unit for Gas pressure is expressed in Pascals (Pa).

Example 1
There are 500 moles of gas molecules in a container. If 220 K temperature is applied to the gas of a volume of 40 L, identify the Gas pressure.
Solution
Given :

Internal Energy Formula is the heat energy stocked in gas. If a certain amount of heat is applied to gas, the result is that the temperature of the gas may increase or else the volume of gas might increase. In this manner doing some work externally or volume and temperature may both intensify, but it will be made definite by the situations under which the gas is provided heat.
When the structure is left in a situation which differs from its condition before the process, after the process, it can be articulated as
ΔΔU = U2 &#8211; U1 = Q – wt/J
Or else
Q = (U2 &#8211; U1) + W
U1 is termed as the internal energy of the system at the commencement of the procedure, and the internal energy at the culmination of the procedure is U2.

Solved Problems
Problem 1: Calculate the change in internal energy of the working fluid stating whether it is a gain or loss when in an internal combustion engine, the heat rejected to the cooling water during the compression stroke is 50 KJ/kg and the work input is 100 KJ/kg.
Answer:
Heat given to the cooling water
Work input W = &#8211; 100 KJ/kg
Q = &#8211; 50 KJ/kg
Using the formula,
Q =  (U2 &#8211; U1) + W
&#8211; 50 =  (U2 &#8211; U1) &#8211; 100
U2 &#8211; U1 = &#8211; 50 + 100
U2 &#8211; U1 = 50 KJ/kg
Therefore, the increases in internal energy is = 50 KJ/kg
Problem 2: The compressed air in an air motor cylinder has an internal energy of 450 KJ/kg at the commencement of the expansion and an internal energy of 220 KJ/kg afterwards the expansion. If the effort completed by the air throughout the expansion is 120 KJ/kg, compute the heat flow back and forth from the cylinder.
Answer:
Internal energy at commencement of the expansion
U1 = 450 KJ/kg
Internal energy afterwards the expansion
U2 = 220 KJ/kg
Work done by the air for the duration of the expansion
W = 120 KJ/kg
Calculate the Heat flow Q by means of the equation = (U2 &#8211; U1) + W
Q = (220 &#8211; 450) + 120
Q = &#8211; 230 + 120
= &#8211; 110 KJ/kg
Thus, the heat rejected by the air is 110 KJ/kg

<b>Molarity Formula:</b>
The equation for <a href="https://byjus.com/molarity-calculator/" target="_blank">calculating molarity</a> is the ratio of the moles of solute whose molarity is to be calculated and the volume of solvent used to dissolve the given solute. 
\(M = \frac{n}{V}\)
Here, M is the molality of the solution that is to be calculated, n is the number of moles of the solute and V is the volume of solution given in terms of litres. 
A solution is prepared by bubbling 1.56 grams of hydrochloric acid in water. Here, the volume of the solution is 26.8 mL. Calculate the molarity of the solution. 
<b>Solution: </b>
The chemical formula of hydrochloric acid = HCl
The chemical formula for Water = H2O
The molecular weight of HCl = 35.5 ×1 + 1×1 = 36.5 moles/gram
The molecular weight of H2O = 1 ×2 + 16 ×1 = 18 moles/gram
Given, mass of hydrochloric acid in the solution = 1.56 g
The number of moles of hydrochloric acid = 
\(n_{T}=\frac{mass\;in\;grams}{molecular\;weight}\)
\(n_{T}=\frac{1.56}{36.5}=4.27\times 10^{-2}mole\)
Expressing the volume in terms of litres, 
\(volume = \frac{26.8}{1000}=2.68\times 10^{-2}Litre\)
\(Molarity = \frac{Number\;of\;moles\;of\;element}{volume\;of\;solution\;in\;litres}\)
\(Molality = \frac{4.27\times 10^{-2}}{2.68\times 10^{-2}}=1.59M\)
<b>Example 2: </b>
A solution prepared using 15 g of sodium sulphate. The volume of the solution is 125 ml. Calculate the molarity of the given solution of sodium sulphate. 
<b>Solution: </b>
The molecular formula for sodium sulphate is Na2SO4.
The molecular formula for water is H2O. 
The molecular mass of sodium sulphate is calculated as given below, 
M=23×2+32+16×4=142
The number of moles of sodium sulphate in the given question is calculated as, 
\(n=\frac{mass\;in\;grams}{molecular\;weight}=\frac{15}{142}=0.106\)
The volume of the solution is 125 ml. 
Expressing the above values in terms of litres, 
\(Volume = \frac{125}{1000}=0.125\)
Now, using the formula given above, we calculate the molarity of the given solution. 
\(molarity = \frac{number\;of\;moles\;of\;solute}{volume\;of\;solution}\)
Substituting the values, we get, 
\(molarity=\frac{0.106}{0.125}=0.85M\)
The molarity of the given solution is 0.85M.

What is Molar Volume?
The Molar Volume, represented by V<sub>m</sub>, is the volume occupied by one mole of a substance which can be a chemical element or a chemical compound at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). It can be calculated by dividing Molar mass (M) by mass density (ρ). One mole of any gas at a particular temperature and pressure has fixed volume and known as its Molar gas volume.

Molar Volume formula
The Molar volume is directly proportional to molar mass and inversely proportional to density. The formula of molar volume is expressed as

uRLStringLine class="alignnone" title="V_{m}=Atomic\;weight\times\frac{Molar\;Mass}{Density}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_{m}=Atomic\;weight\times\frac{Molar\;Mass}{Density}" width="291" height="42" />

Where V<sub>m</sub> is the volume of the substance. 

The standard temperature used is 273 Kelvin or 0^oC, and standard pressure is 1 atmospheres, i.e., 760 mm Hg. Experimentally, one mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters at STP. The equation can be expressed as

1 mole of gas at STP = 22.4 liters of gas. 

Example 1
The decomposition of NaClO<sub>3</sub> produces NaCl and O2. Determine the volume of O<sub>2</sub> if 42.6 g NaClO<sub>3</sub> decomposes at STP? The density is given to be 0.213g/m<sub>3</sub>.

Solution
Parameters given are,
Density(ρ) = 0.215kg/m<sub>3</sub>
Molar mass = 42.5g/mol = 0.0425kg/mol
Atomic weight = 96 
To substitute in the equation
Vm = Atomic weight x Molar mass / Density
      = 96 x 0.0425 / 0.215
Therefore, Vm = 18.976 m<sub>3</sub>/mol

Example 2
Calculate the molar volume of Ice when the density = 0.9167 g/cm<sub>3</sub>, molar mass = 18g and atomic weight is 18.02g.

Solution
Parameters given are,
Density = 0.9167 g/cm<sub>3</sub>
Molar mass = 0.018kg
Atomic weight = 18.02g
Substitute in the formula for molar volume, we get
Vm = 18.02 x 0.018 / 0.0009167
      = 353.83m<sub>3</sub>/mol

Osmosis is the phenomenon of the route of solvent but not solute through a semipermeable membrane from solvent to the solution or from weak to concentrated solution. The natural phenomenon like pure water from the sea, industrial extraction and purification are based on the osmosis process. Osmosis can be described as a selective separation aspect.
What is osmotic pressure?
Osmotic pressure is the excess pressure required to be applied to a solution to prevent osmosis when the solution is separated from a solvent via semipermeable membrane, usually denoted by ‘π.&#8217;
According to Van’t Hoff’s law, Osmotic Pressure formula is given by
Osmotic Pressure = iRTc
Where,
i = number of ions created by dissociation of solute molecules
 R = ideal gas constant
 T = absolute temperature in K
 C = molar or molal concentration
The formula which relates osmotic pressure to temperature and concentration is similar to ideal gas equation.

Where,
‘π’ is the osmotic pressure in mmHg
 n = number of solute particles
<span style="line-height: 1.42857;"> R = universal gas constant
 V = volume of the solution in litres
Example 1
Determine the osmotic pressure of the aqueous solution which contains 14g of urea in 300cm3 of the solution at 250C.
Solution
The given entities are
  i = 14g
T = 25oC = 298K
c = 300 cm3
R = 8.314 JK-1mol^-1
We have an equation
Osmotic pressure = iRTc
Substituting the above values, we get
Osmotic pressure = 14g x 8.314 JK^-1mol^-1 x 298K x 300cm^3
Osmotic pressure = 104.05 x 105 Nm^-2

Example 2
Determine the osmotic pressure of a solution made by adding 13.65g of sucrose(C12H22O11) in water to make 250 mL of solution at 25^oC.
Solution
Calculate the concentration of sucrose
Molar mass of sucrose = 12(2) + 22(1) + 11(16)
Molar mass = 342 
 nsucrose = 13.65 x 1 mol / 342  
 nsucrose = 0.04 mol
 msucrose = nsucrose / volumesolution
         = 0.04mol/0.25L
          = 0.16mol/L
T = 25oC + 273
        = 298 K
Osmotic Pressure, ‘π’ = iMRT
            = 1 x 0.16 mol / L x 0.08206 x 298 K 
            = 3.9atm
Hence, the osmotic pressure of sucrose = 3.9atm

pH is a measure of the amount of activity of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution and thus its alkalinity or acidity. Although a pH value is unitless, it is not a random scale; the number rises from a description grounded on the activity of hydrogen ions in the solution. pH is described as &#8220;the negative of the logarithm of the molar hydronium-ion concentration.&#8221;
pH Formula is arithmetically articulated as

Problem 1: Calculate the pH of human arterial blood in which the hydronium ion concentration is 4.0 ×× 10-8M.
Answer:
The concentration of hydronium ion is 4.0 × 10-8M

pH = &#8211; log[4.0 × 10-8]
pH = 7.40
As the hydronium ion concentration is provided till two decimal places we can note the pH with two significant figures.

Problem 2: A brand of carbonated beverage has a pH of 3.16. What is the hydronium ion concentration of the beverage?
Answer:
The concentration of hydronium ion is

[H3O+] = antilog (-3.16) = 10-3.16
[H3O+] = 7.0 × 10-4M

 All round us we have Chemical compounds &#8211; they are in our beverages, food and in items one uses day to day. We can identify these chemical compounds by their molecular formulas. Though the molecular formula demonstrates how many atoms there are for every element existing in the compound, it does not communicate to us about by what means the elements are attached to each other. We have no idea which atom of an element is attached to which. This is the place where the structural formula arises. It displays how the atoms are organized and attached together in a molecular formula of a chemical compound. Deprived of the structural formula, one would not discern that acetic acid has a carbon atom double-bonded together with oxygen. One can see the spatial arrangement of the atoms in the compound, by taking a look at the formula.

The electron dot structural formula depiction uses dots to signify the electrons involved with the bonding amid different atoms.The line-bond structural formula is a very frequently used depiction of the structural formula. As the term puts forward, the line-bond structural formula makes use of lines and bonds to show the covalent bonds between atoms.

The condensed formula still makes use of lines amongst bonded atoms but is a stress-free and smaller method to draw the line-bond structural formula because it omits the carbon and hydrogen bonds.

The sensible heat is a type of energy released or absorbed in the atmosphere. Sensible heat concerns about changes in temperature of a gas or object but no change in phase.Latent heat is relevant to changes in phases between solids, liquids and gases. You can use sensible heat formula to calculate the flow of air for an electric furnace. The formula provides the amount of airflow. The sensible heat formula with change in temperature is given by
Q <sub>sensible</sub>= 1.10 x c<span style="font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0px;">fm x (t<sub>o</sub> – t<sub>i</sub>)

1.10 = product of heat capacity of air 0.018 Btu/oF,
C<span style="font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0px;">fm = rate of flow of air entering from outside,
t<sub>o</sub>= Temperature outside in oF,
t<sub>i </sub>= Temperature inside in oF.

Example 1
Air consists of 100 grams of moisture per pound of dry air and inside air contains 72 grams per pound of dry air. Calculate the sensible heat gain.
Solution
Q<sub>sensible</sub> = 0.68 x cfm x (100 – 72)

The molecular formula is the expression of the number of atoms of each element in one molecule of a compound. 
The molecular formula definition is the formula showing the actual number of each atom in a molecule. 
When the molar mass value is known, the Molecular Formula is calculated by the empirical formula.  





The molecular formula is often same as empirical formula or an exact multiple of it. 

Example 1
Caffeine has the following composition: 49.48% of carbon, 5.19% of hydrogen, 16.48% of oxygen and 28.85% of nitrogen. The molecular weight is 194.19 g/mol. Find out the molecular and empirical formula.

Solution
Step 1
Multiply percent composition with the molecular weight
Carbon &#8211; 194.19 x 0.4948 = 96.0852
Hydrogen &#8211; 194.19 x 0.0519 = 10.07846
Oxygen &#8211;  194.19 x 0.1648 = 32.0025
Nitrogen &#8211; 194.19 x 0.2885 = 56.0238

Step 2
Divide each value by the atomic weight
Carbon : 96.0852 / 12.011 = 7.9997
Hydrogen : 10.07846 / 1.008 = 9.998
Oxygen : 32.0025 / 15.9994 = 2.000
Nitrogen : 56.0238 / 14.0067 = 3.9997

Step 3
Round off the values to closest whole number
8: Carbon
10: Hydrogen
2: Oxygen
4: Nitrogen 
Hence, the molecular formula is C8H10N4O2.

Step 4
Since 2 is the common factor among 8, 10, 4 and 2. 
The empirical formula is C4H5N2O.

Example 2
A compound contains 86.88% of carbon and 13.12% of hydrogen, and the molecular weight is 345. What will be the empirical and molecular formula of the compound? 

Solution
Step 1
Carbon : 345 x 0.8688 = 299.736
Hydrogen : 345 x 0.1312 = 45.264

Step 2
Carbon : 299.736 / 12.011 = 24.995
Hydrogen : 45.264 / 1.008 = 44.91

Step 3
Molecular formula is C25H45

The Percent solutions can be in the form of weight/volume % (wt/vol % or w/v %), volume/volume % (vol/vol % or v/v %) or, weight/weight % (wt/wt % or w/w %). In each case, the concentration in percentage is calculated as the fraction of the volume or weight of the solute related to the total volume or weight or of the solution.Not only for a solution where concentration needs to be expressed in volume percent (v/v%) when the solute is a liquid, but it is also applicable to the numerator in weight units and the denominator in volume units and called weight/volume percent.
Volume percent = Volume of solute / volume of solution x 100
The formula relates to volume fraction by dividing by 100%
Example 1
Determine the volume/volume percent solution made by combining 25 mL of ethanol with enough water to produce 200 mL of the solution.
Solution
Given parameters are
Volume of solute is 25 mL
Volume of solution is 200 mL
Substitute the values in the given formula,
Volume percent = volume of solute /volume of solution x 100%
= 25 mL / 200 mL x 100%
= 12.5 %

Example 2
A solution is prepared by dissolving 90 mL of hydrogen peroxide in enough water to make 3000 mL of solution. Identify the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide solution.
Solution
The given parameters are
Volume of solute is 90 mL
Volume of solution is 3000 mL
Substitute the values in the given formula,
Volume percent = volume of solute /volume of solution x 100%
 = 90 mL/ 3000mL x 100%
Volume percent = 3 %

The spontaneous breakdown of an atomic nucleus of a radioactive substance resulting in the emission of radiation from the nucleus is known as Radioactive decay. The nuclide which undergoes decay in a radioactive process is a parent nuclide, and the nuclide which is produced in the radioactive process is a daughter nuclide.
The Radioactive Formula is given by
Where N<sub>0</sub> = the initial quantity of the substance and N is the quantity still remained and not yet decayed.
T is the half-life of the decaying quantity
e is the Euler’s number equal to 2.71828
The differential equation of Radioactive Decay Formula is defined as
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/radioactive-decay1.png" />
The half-life of an isotope is the time taken by its nucleus to decay to half of its original number. It can be expressed as
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/half-life.png" />

Example 1 &#8211; Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5.730 years. Determine the decay rate of Carbon-14.
Solution &#8211; If 100 mg of carbon-14 (N0 = 100) has a half- life of 5.730 years (t=5.730). The remaining 50 mg is present (N=50). We can use the formula.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/radioactive-decay-formula.png" />

50 = 100 λ(5.730)
0.5 = e 5.730 λ
5.730 λ = ln 0.5
λ = ln0.5/5.730
λ = -0.525

Example 2 &#8211; 100 mg of <a href="https://byjus.com/chemistry/neptunium/">neptunium</a> -239(239Np) decays to 73.36mg in 24 hours. Determine the value of λ in growth decay formula for t in days?
Solution- Given that N = 73.36, N0 = 100 and t = 1(day), we can use the equation

uRLStringLine class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/radioactive-decay-formula.png" />
73.36 = 100 eλ(1)
0.7336 = eλ
λ = ln 0.7336
λ = -0.309791358
Therefore, the decay rate is approximately 31%.

The term solubility is all about to measure the quantity of solute dissolved in a particular solvent. The simple definition of solubility is solubility of a substance is the molarity of that substance in a solution which is at chemical equilibrium under excessive undissolved substance. This states that there must be a uniform temperature throughout the system, since solubility is temperature dependent.The Solubility Formula can be mathematically expressed as

uRLStringLine title="\large S=\sqrt{K_{sp}}" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&amp;space;\large&amp;space;S=\sqrt{K_{sp}}" alt="" />

The expression for solubility product has the same general form than other equilibrium constant expressions and K<sub>SP</sub> is called solubility product constant &#8221;
Example 1
Determine the solubility of calcium fluoride C<sub>a</sub>F<sub>2</sub>
Solution:
<span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The equilibrium for this salt is,
CaF<sub>2</sub>(s) ⇋⇋ Ca+(aq) + 2F&#8211;(aq)
The K<sub>sp</sub> expression is expressed as 
K<sub>sp</sub> = [Ca^2+][F&#8211;]^2 = 4.0 times 10^-11 M^3
Let S be the solubility of the Ca^2+ ion
Then 2S is  the solubility of the F&#8211; ion.
Substitute S in the K<sub>sp</sub> expression, we get
(S)(2S)^2 = 4.0 × 10^11
4S^<sub>3</sub> = 4 × 10^11
S = 2.15 ×10^-4M

 Example 2
The molar solubility of tin iodide SnI2 is 1.28 x 10-2 mol/L. Calculate the Ksp of this compound.
Solution:
The solubility equilibrium of SnI<sub>2</sub> is 
SnI<sub>2</sub>(s) ⇋⇋ Sn^<sub>2</sub>+(aq) + 2I&#8211;(aq)
The K<sub>sp</sub> expression is written as 
K<sub>sp</sub> = [Sn^2+][I&#8211;]^2
1 mol of SnI2 Produces 1.0 mol of Sn2+, but 2.0mol of I&#8211;.
[Sn^2+] = 1.28 × 10^-2M
[I^&#8211;] = (2) × 1.28 × 10^-2M
 = 2.56 × 10^-2M
Substitute these values in K<sub>sp</sub> expression
K<sub>sp</sub> = (1.28 ×× 10-2M)(2.56 ×× 10-2M)2
Therefore, K<sub>sp</sub> = 8.4 × 10-6 M^2

The quantity of a product obtained from a reaction is expressed in terms of the yield of the reaction. The amount of product predicted by stoichiometry is called the theoretical yield, whereas the amount obtained actually is called the actual yield. <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857;">A reaction yield is reported as a percent yield which gives the percentage of the theoretical amount.

The combined gas law is the law which combines Charles’s law, Gay-Lussac’s law and Boyle’s law. It’s an amalgamation of the three previously discovered laws. These laws relate one thermodynamic variable to another holding everything else constant.The interdependence of these variables represents combined gas law which states that the ratio between the product of pressure-volume and temperature of a system remains constant.
Combined gas law can be mathematically expressed as
P = pressure
T = temperature in kelvins
V = volume
K is constant (units of energy divided by temperature)
When two substances are compared in two different conditions, the law can be stated as,

                     uRLStringLine title="\frac{P_{i}V_{i}}{T_{i}}=\frac{P_{f}V_{f}}{T_{f}}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{P_{i}V_{i}}{T_{i}}=\frac{P_{f}V_{f}}{T_{f}}" />
Where,
Pi = initial pressure
Vi = initial volume
Ti = initial temperature
Pf = final pressure
Vf = final volume
Tf = final temperature

Example 1
The initial volume of the gas is 5L and final volume is 3L Calculate the final pressure of gas, given that the initial temperature is 273 K, final temperature is 200k, and initial pressure is 25K Pa
Solution
According to the given parameters,
Pi = 25 kPa
Vi = 5L
Vf = 3L
Ti = 273K
Tf = 200K
According to combined gas law,

Substituting in the formula, we get
25 x 5 / 273 =  Pf x 3 / 200
Therefore, Pf = 30.525 kPa

Example 2
Determine the volume of a gas given Vi = 3L, Ti = 300K, Tf = 250K, Pi = 35 KPa and Pf = 50 kPa
Solution
Given Parameters are
Pi = 35 kPa

Ti = 300K
Pf = 50 kPa
Tf = 250K
According to given parameters, we have an equation

Substituting in the above equation, we get
35 x 3 / 300 = 50 x Vf / 250
Therefore, Vf = 1.75 L

A compound&#8217;s molecular formula is a derivative of its molecular weight (which was determined independently) and elemental analysis. The notion of the degree of unsaturation of an organic compound is derived simply from the tetravalency of carbon. Any compound whose chemical formula has two hydrogen less than the maximum number possible (2n+2) must have one ring or one double bond. The Degree of Unsaturation is the rings plus the total number of multiple bonds. The molecular formula is abridged to CnHm and the Degree of Unsaturation Formula is given by

Degree of unsaturation = Total number of rings + Total number of double bonds + (2 x total number of triple bonds)
The formula for degree of unsaturation is articulated like this, if the molecular formula is given,

uRLStringLine title="P_{gas}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P_{gas}" alt="" /> is the partial pressure of the gas (units in Atm)

Example 1
Determine the quantity of carbon dioxide dissolved in a 1L bottle of carbonated water if the pressure of 2.4 atm is applied in the bottling process at 25 Degree Celsius? Given that uRLStringLine title="K_{H}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K_{H}" alt="" /> of uRLStringLine title="CO_{ 2}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?CO_{&amp;space;2}" /> in water is 29.76 atm/(mol/L) at 25 Degree Celsius.
Solution
We know the equation
P= uRLStringLine title="K_{H}C" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K_{H}C" alt="" />
Therefore,
C = P/KH
    = 2.4 /29.76
    = 0.08 mol/L of CO2
To convert into grams,
1 mole of CO2
= 12 + (16 x 2) = 44g
Mass of CO2 in grams  = mol of CO2 x 44 g/mol
    = 8.06 x 10-2 x 44
    = 3.52 g of CO2 is dissolved in 1 L of carbonated water. 

Example 2
Determine the solubility of carbon dioxide in water at 0oC and pressure of 3.0 atm. Given that Carbon dioxide solubility is 0.348 g/100 mL.

The energy essential to take away an electron from a gaseous atom A or a gaseous molecule AB is titled as ionization energy. Referring to the following equation. A mass spectrometer can determine the ionization energy. The ionization energy or potential is therefore sometimes also called the &#8220;threshold&#8221; or &#8220;appearance&#8221; energy or potential.
Energy + A →→ A + e-
Energy + AB →→ AB + e-
is called as the ionization energy of the molecule or atom.
How tightly an atom holds onto its electrons is measured by the ionization energy. The tighter an electron is held, the higher is its ionization energy. The developments in ionization energy are just the reverse of those for atomic radii. Usually, as the atomic radii get bigger, ionization energies get lesser and vice versa.
Solved Problems &#8211; Ionization Energy
 
Problem 1: in both copper and potassium the outer electron is to be removed from the 4s-orbital. Why is the first ionization energy for copper (745 kJ mol-1) higher than that of potassium (418 kJ mol-1).
Answer: 
In both these elements the external electron is in the 4s level, but however in potassium the nucleus’s positive charge (Z=19) is curtained by the argon core: 1s22s22p63s3p6, in copper the nuclear charge (z=29) is curtained by 3d electrons and the argon core.
The ten extra electrons in copper are in the 3d level. The diffused, and strongly directional d-electrons protect the 4s electron somewhat poorly from the nuclear charge, it thus experiences a highly effective nuclear charge, and the ionization energy of copper is far greater than that of potassium.
Problem 2: Compute the energy essential to convert all the Al atoms to Al3+ ions existent in 0.720g of Al vapors.The ionization energies first, second and third respectively of Al are 578, 1817 and 2745kJ mol-1.
Answer:
Total energy required for the change Al → Al3+
= IE1 + IE2 + IE3
= 578 + 1817 + 2745 kJ mol-1
= 5140 kJ mol-1
Number of mole in 0.720 gm of Al =

Therefore, the sum of mole fraction of all the components is always equal to one. 
Please note that mole fraction represents a fraction of molecules, and since different molecules have different masses, the mole fraction is different from the mass fraction.

Example 2
Determine the mole fraction of methanol CH<sub>3</sub>OH and water in a solution prepared by dissolving 4.5 g of alcohol in 40 g of H<sub>2</sub>O. M of H<sub>2</sub>O is 18 and M of CH<sub>3</sub>OH is 32.

Solution
Moles of CH<sub>3</sub>OH = 4.5 / 32 = 0.14 mole
Moles of H<sub>2</sub>O = 40 / 18 = 2.2 moles
Therefore, according to the equation
mole fraction of CH<sub>3</sub>OH = 0.14 / 2.2 + 0.14 
        
                                      = 0.061

The molecules of air frequently bump into the walls of the vessel. These impacts apply an energy on the walls of the vessel which is not anything but termed as pressure. The pressure exerted by the gas is force per unit area. Though as we know, air is a mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, etc. and not a single compound. The pressure that is contributed by every gas is termed its partial pressure. Partial pressure can, therefore, be explained as the pressure applied if that gas by itself had engaged the volume. Therefore, the entire pressure of air will be the summation of partial pressures of oxygen, nitrogen, etc.

<b>The aggregate pressure is, therefore, the summation of partial pressures of the ideal gases. This is articulated by Dalton&#8217;s law of partial pressures.</b>

<b>Solved Examples</b>
Problem 1: To a tank containing O2 at 1.0atm and N2 at 2.0atm, we add an anonymous quantity of CO2 up until the total pressure inside the tank is 4.6atm. What is the CO2’s partial pressure?
Answer:
Dalton’s law states that the addition of CO2 does not upset the partial pressures of the O2 and N2 already existing in the tank. The partial pressure of O2 and N2 remain at 2.0atm, respectively, and their total is 3.0atm. The partial pressure of the added CO2 must be 1.6 atm if the new pressure is 4.6atm, Therefore, when the final pressure is 4.6atm, the partial pressures are
uRLStringLine title="Partial Pressure" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/partial-pressure.jpg" alt="Partial Pressure" />
4.6atm = 2.0atm + 1.0atm + 1.6atm

Problem 2: What is the partial pressure of the water vapor when a vessel under 2.015atm pressure contains water vapor H2O and nitrogen N2. The partial pressure of N2 is 1.908atm.
Solution:
Given
Total pressure = 2.015atm
Partial pressure of N2 = 1.908atm
Partial pressure of water vapor = ?
At present, we make use of the equation

uRLStringLine title="Partial Pressure" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/partial-pressure.jpg" alt="Partial Pressure" />
Partial Pressure
P total = PN2 + P water vapor
2.015 = 1.908 + P water vapor
P water vapor = 0.107

Partition coefficients are described as the concentration ratio of a chemical amidst the two media at equilibrium. The media can be gases such as air, liquids such as water or olive oil, or complex mixtures such as blood or other tissues. However, the partition coefficients of an uncharged solute in two different two-phase systems of identical Δw2, in general, are unequal.

The formula for partition coefficient is,
uRLStringLine title="\large K_{d}=\frac{C_{s}}{C_{m}}" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{120}&amp;space;\large&amp;space;K_{d}=\frac{C_{s}}{C_{m}}" alt="" />
Where,
In stationary phase, the concentration of the solute is C<sub>s</sub>,
In mobile phase, the concentration of the solute is C<sub>m</sub>.
