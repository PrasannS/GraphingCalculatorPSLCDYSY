Acceleration Formula
One may have perceived that pushing a terminally ill bus can give it a sudden start. That’s because lift provides upward push when it starts. Here Velocity changes and this is acceleration! Henceforth, the frame accelerates. Acceleration is described as the rate of change of velocity of an object. A body&#8217;s acceleration is the final result of all the forces being applied on the body, as defined by Newton&#8217;s Second Law. Acceleration is a vector quantity that is described as the frequency at which a body’s  velocity changes.

Average Force Formula
The force applied by a body that’s traveling at a definite velocity (rate of speed) for a definite period of time is the average force. The word<em> &#8216;average&#8217; </em>is made use of to specify that this velocity is not an<em> </em>accurately measured or <em>&#8216;instantaneous&#8217;</em>  velocity. Therefore, the mass of the body multiplied by the average velocity over the definite time is equivalent to average force.
For a particular interval of time t, the force is described as the frequency of change of momentum. It is hard to compute the rate of change if the time interval is minor. There the term, average force makes an entrance.
Over a period of intervals (Δ t) the rate of change of momentum is Average force. It is given by
uRLStringLine "F=\frac{m(V_{f}-V_{i})}{\Delta _{t}}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F=\frac{m(V_{f}-V_{i})}{\Delta&amp;space;_{t}}" width="127" height="42" 
Where,
The Average Force Formula aids one in getting the rate of change of momentum for any number of time intervals  (Δ t). Expressed in Newton (N).

Fundamental to fluid mechanics Archimedes&#8217; principle is a fundamental law of physics. Archimedes&#8217; principle indicates that the increasing buoyant force that is applied on a body submerged in a liquid, whether partially or fully immersed, is equivalent to the mass of the fluid that the form displaces. The object will sink, if the mass of the water displaced is less than the weight of the body, otherwise, the body will float, with the weight of the water displaced equivalent to the mass of the object.
When a body is totally or partly submerged in a fluid it experiences buoyancy (upward force) that is equivalent to the mass of the fluid displaced.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter" title="F=\rho gV" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F=\rho&amp;space;gV" width="71" height="16" 
Where, Buoyant force of a given body = F,
As we see that density ρρ = ρf &#8211; ρg. Here ρf is the density of the fluid and ρg is the density of the body.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter" title="F=(\rho_{f}-\rho_{g})gV" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F=(\rho_{f}-\rho_{g})gV" width="132" height="20" 
Archimedes principle formula is helpful in finding the buoyant force, the volume of displaced body, the density of fluid or density of body if some of these numerics are known.
Archimedes Principle Problems Solved Examples
Underneath are given some problems based on Archimedes principle.
Problem 1: A ball of mass 2 kg that has a diameter of 50 cm falls in the pool. Compute its buoyant force and volume of water displaced.
Known:
Mass of water, m = 2 kg,
Diameter of ball, d = 0.5 m r = 0.25 m
uRLStringLine src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Volume\,&space;of\,&space;sphere\,&space;V=\frac{4}{3}\;\Pi&space;r^{3}=\frac{4}{3}\;\Pi\;&space;0.25^{3}" title="Volume\, of\, sphere\, V=\frac{4}{3}\;\Pi r^{3}=\frac{4}{3}\;\Pi\; 0.25^{3}" 
uRLStringLine src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Hence\,&space;the\,&space;density\,&space;is\,&space;given\,&space;by\,&space;\rho&space;=\frac{Mass}{Volume}=\frac{2kg}{0.0208m^{3}}" title="Hence\, the\, density\, is\, given\, by\, \rho =\frac{Mass}{Volume}=\frac{2kg}{0.0208m^{3}}" 
The force is given by F = mg. Hence buoyant force is
F = 2 kg × 9.8 m/s^2 = 19.6 N
The Archimedes formula is given by F = ρρ g V<sub>disp</sub>
uRLStringLine src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Hence\,&space;the\,&space;volume\,&space;of\,&space;displaced\,&space;fluid\,&space;is\,&space;V_{disp}=\frac{F}{\rho&space;g}=\frac{19.6}{96\times&space;9.8}=0.0208\,m^{3}" title="Hence\, the\, volume\, of\, displaced\, fluid\, is\, V_{disp}=\frac{F}{\rho g}=\frac{19.6}{96\times 9.8}=0.0208\,m^{3}" 
Hence volume of given body=Volume of displaced liquid
Problem 2: Calculate the buoyant force acting on it, if a stone of mass 250 g is thrown in water?
Known: m (Mass of stone) = 0.25 kg,
F = mg
Thus, 2.45 N of upward force is being applied on the stone.

Angular acceleration is denoted by α and is expressed in the units of rad/s2 or radians per second square. 
Formula:
Angular acceleration can be expressed as given below, 
\(\alpha =\frac{d\omega }{dt}\)
And also in terms of the double differentiation of the angular displacement, as given below, 
\(\alpha = \frac{d^{2}\theta}{ dt^{2}}\)
Derivation:
Angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity with respect to time, or we can write it as, 
\(\alpha = \frac{d\omega }{dt}\)
Here, α is the angular <a href="https://byjus.com/physics/acceleration/" target="_blank">acceleration</a> that is to be calculated, in terms of rad/s2, ω is the angular velocity given in terms of rad/s and t is the time taken expressed in terms of seconds.
Angular velocity as we know, can be expressed as given below. 
\(\omega = \frac{v}{r}\)

Here, ω is the angular velocity in terms of rad/s, v is the linear velocity and r is the radius of the path taken. 
Angular Velocity  can also be expressed as the change in angular displacement with respect to time, as given below.
\(\omega = \frac{\theta }{t}\)
Where, θ is the angular rotation of the object and t is the total time taken.
Using the above formula, we can write angular acceleration α as
\(\alpha = \frac{d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}\)
Real Life Example:</b>
Example  1: </b>
An ant is sitting at the edge of a rotating circular disc. It&#8217;s angular velocity changes at the rate of 60 rad/s for 10 seconds. Calculate its angular acceleration during this time?
Given: The change in angular velocity is equal to dω = 60 rad/s. The time taken for this change to occur is equal to t = 10s. 
Using the formula for angular acceleration and substituting the above values, we get, 
\(\alpha = \frac{d\omega }{dt}=\frac{30}{5}=6\;rad/s^{2}\)

Example  2: </b>
The rear wheel of a motorcycle has an angular acceleration of 20 rad/s2 in a second. What can be said about its angular velocity?
Given: The angular acceleration of the wheel is equal to α = 10 \(rad/s^{2}\),
According to the formula for angular acceleration,
\(\alpha = \frac{d\omega }{dt}\)
Upon substituting the values, we get,
Angular velocity d is
dω =20×1 = 20 rad/s

Formula: Angular displacement of a point can be given by using the following formula, 
\(Angular displacement = \theta _{f}- \theta _{i}\)
Where,
\(\theta = s/r\)

Here, θ is the angular displacement of the object through which the movement has occurred, s is the distance covered by the object on the circular path and r is the radius of curvature of the given path.  
When the acceleration of the object, the initial velocity and the time at which the displacement is to be calculated is known, we can use the following formula. 
\(\theta = wt + 1/2 \alpha t^{2}\)

Here, ω is the initial angular velocity, t is the time at which the angular displacement is to be calculated and α is the angular acceleration of the object. 
Derivation: 
Let us consider an object ‘A’ undergoing linear motion with initial velocity ‘u’ and acceleration ‘a’. Let us say, after time t, the final <a href="https://byjus.com/physics/velocity/" target="_blank">velocity</a> of the object is ‘v’ and the total displacement of the object is ‘s’. 
We know that acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity. Or we can write, 
\(a = \frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{d} t}\)

We can also write it as, 
\(dv = a dt\)

Integrating both the sides, we get, 
\(\int_{u}^{v} dv = a \int_{0}^{t} dt\)

\(v &#8211; u = at\)
Also, 
\(a = \frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{d} t}\)

\(a = \frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{d} x} / \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}\)
As we know v=dxdt, we can write, 
\(a = v \frac{\mathrm{d} v}{\mathrm{d} x}\)

v dv=a dx
Upon integrating both the sides of the equation, we get, 
\(\int_{u}^{v} v dv = a \int_{0}^{s} dx\)
\(v^{2} &#8211; u^{2} =2as\)

Now, substituting the value of u from the first equation into the second equation, we get, 
\(v^{2} -(v- at)^{2} = 2as\)
\(2vat &#8211; a^{2}t^{2}= 2as\)

Dividing both the sides of the equation by 2a, we get, 
\(s = vt &#8211; \frac{1}{2} at^{2}\)

Upon substituting the value of v instead of u we get, 
\(s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}\)
1) Neena goes around a circular track that has a diameter of 8.5 m. If she runs around the entire track for a distance of 60 m, what is her angular displacement?

Answer:</b> 
According to question, Neena&#8217;s linear displacement, s = 60 m. 
Also, the diameter of the curved path, d = 8.5
As we know that, d = 2r, so r = 4.25 m. 
And according to formula for angular displacement, 

\(\theta = \frac{s}{r}\)

θ = 60m /4.25 m
θ = 14.12 radians

2) Rohit bought a pizza of radius of 0.5 m. A fly lands on the pizza and walks around the edge for a distance of 80 cm. Calculate the angular displacement of the fly?

Answer:  </b>
According to question, the distance travelled by the fly on the pizza is, s = 80 cm = 0.08 m. 
The radius of the pizza is given to be, r = 0.5 m.
Using the formula for angular displacement,

\(\theta = \frac{s}{r}\)

θ = 0.08m/0.5 m
θ = 0.16 radians

The average speed is a scalar quantity, which means, it is only represented by the magnitude and direction of travel is not important and is linked to the distance covered by the object.

Beat Frequency Formula
Beat is a word linked to sound waves. The beat frequency is not anything but the difference in frequency of two wave. It is because of the constructive and destructive interferences. When two sound waves of dissimilar frequency approach your ear, the alternating productive and damaging interference causes the sound to be alternatively loud and soft &#8211; a phenomenon which is termed as &#8220;beating&#8221; or producing beats. The beat frequency is equivalent to the complete value of the alteration in frequency of the two waves. The count of beats per second is equivalent to the difference in frequency. Conferring to these interferences, sound will be loud or soft. Actually, the beat frequency is the complete value of the difference in wave frequencies. The formula for the beat frequency is,

Brewster&#8217;s Law Brewster derived a relation amongst the polarizing angle ip and the refractive index mu which is well known as Brewster’s law. This says that the tangent of the polarizing angle is numerically equivalent to the refractive index of the medium.
A polarizing angle is created when at a certain angle of incidence, the reflected light is completely polarized, and this specific value of the angle of incidence is identified as polarizing angle. The polarizing angle ip hinges on on the refractive index mu of the transparent material.
The relation is articulated by “µ = tan ip”
When unpolarized light is found to be incident on a transparent medium at any polarizing angle then the transmitted and reflected rays are vertical to each other.

Problem 1: Refractive index of a polarizer is found to be 1.9128. Find the polarization angle and angle of refraction?
Answer:
Refractive index of the polarizer = 1.9128
The Brewster’s law is μ = tan ip
Or, ip = tan−1tan−1 (1.9128)
Or, ip = 62o 24’
Now, Angle of refraction
It is given that ip + ir = 90 degrees
Thus, angle of refraction or ir = 90 &#8211; 62o 24’

As the word states, Average Velocity is the average value of the known velocities. Displacement over total time is Average Velocity. The average speed of an object is described as the distance traveled divided by the time gone. Velocity is a vector unit, and average velocity can be described as the displacement divided by the time. The units for velocity can be understood from the definition to be meters/second or in common any distance unit over any time unit. The average speed of a body is described as the distance covered divided by the time elapsed.
It is useful in determining the average value of speed if the body is varying continuously for the given time intervals.

The Bulk Modulus is the relative change in the volume of a body produced by a unit compressive or tensile stress acting over its surface uniformly.
The bulk modulus describes how a substance reacts when squeezed uniformly. When the external forces are perpendicular to the surface, it is distributed uniformly over the surface of the object. This may occur when an object is immersed in a fluid and undergo a change in volume but no change in shape.
The ∆P is volume stress defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the change in the amount of force ∆F to the surface area.
The bulk modulus of any liquid is a measure of its compressibility and the pressure required to bring about a unit change in its volume.
Hence, Bulk modulus formula is given by
<strong style="line-height: 1.5;">K = V(∆P) / ∆V
Where,
 ∆P denotes change in pressure 
 ∆V denotes change in volume
The units for the bulk modulus K are psi or kPa.
Example 1
Determine the change in volume if the atmospheric pressure of 0.1 MPa of an aluminium block is reduced to zero when this unit is put in a vacuum. The bulk modulus of aluminium is 120000 MPa.
Solution
Bulk Modulus K = (−ΔP) / ΔV/V
   ∆V / V = −(∆P) / K
   ∆V / V = −(−0.1) / 120000
   ∆V / V = 8.3 x 10-3
Hence, the fractional change in volume is 8.3 x10-3
Example 2
In ammunition testing center the pressure is found to be 255 MPa. Calculate the change in volume of the piece of copper piece when subjected to this pressure in percentage. The bulk modulus of copper is 1.38 x 1011 Pa.
Solution
The pressure in the testing center is 255 MPa.
The bulk modulus is K = (−ΔP) / ΔV(V) 
  (−ΔP) because ∆ V is negative when the ∆ P is positive 
The change in percentage = (ΔV / V) × 100
 = (ΔP / K) × 100
 = 255×106 / 1.38×1011
   Therefore, the change in volume percentage is 0.184 %

Deflection is the degree to which a particular structural element can be displaced by a considerable amount of load. It can be referred to an angle or distance.
The distance of deflection of a member under a load is directly related to the slope of the deflected shape of the member under that load. It can be calculated by integrating the function that describes the slope of the member under that load.
The Beam is a long piece of a body capable of holding the load by resisting the bending. The deflection of the beam towards a particular direction when force is applied on it is called Beam deflection.
Based on the type of deflection there are many beam deflection formulas given below,
w = uniform load (force/length units)
V = shear
I = moment of inertia
E = modulus of elasticity
d = deflection

Capacitance is used to describe how much charge any conductor can hold. It represents the ratio of the charge flowing across the conductor to the potential applied. Capacitors are the conductors used for holding charges. 
Capacitance is the ability of a substance to store an electrical charge. Any object that can be electrically charged shows capacitance. A parallel-plate capacitor is the common form of energy storage device. Capacitance is exhibited by a parallel plate arrangement and defined in terms of charge storage. When a capacitor is charged completely, there is a potential difference between its plates, and larger the area of the plates and/or smaller the distance between them, greater will be the charge of the capacitor and greater will be its Capacitance.
Capacitance Formula is expressed as
C = Q / V
Where,
Q denotes the charge of the conductor, 
V denotes the potential applied across the conductor and
C is proportionality constant, called capacitance
If the capacitors are connected in series, the capacitance formula is expressed by
If capacitors are connected in parallel, the capacitance formula is expressed by
Where C1,C2,C3&#8230;&#8230;.Cn are the capacitors and Capacitance is expressed in Farads
Example 1
Determine the capacitance of the capacitor if 5 coulomb of charge is flowing and 2V of potential is applied.
Solution
Given parameters are
Charge Q is 5 C, 
Voltage applied V is 2 V 
the Capacitance formula is given by
 C = Q / V 
 = 5 / 2
 = 2.5 F 
Example 2
Determine the capacitance if capacitors 6 F and 5 F are connected 
(i) In series and
(ii) In parallel
Solution
The capacitance in series formula is given by 
Cs = 1/C1 + 1/C2 
     = C1+C2 / C1C2 
     = 6+5 / 30
     = 0.367 F 
The capacitance in parallel formula is given by 
Cp = C1 + C2 
      = 6 + 5 
      = 11 F

A buffer solution is an aqueous solution comprising a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or vice versa. There is a minute change in its pH when a small or moderate amount of strong acid or base is added to it and that’s the reason it is used to prevent changes in the pH of a solution.
The pH value of water solvent is 7, but if we add a few drops of HCl or NaOH solution, its pH decreases or increases respectively. Therefore it is necessary to have solutions whose pH does not change even on addition of strong alkalies or strong acids. Such solutions are called buffer solutions.
Buffer capacity is the capacity of a buffer solution to resist change in its pH. The equation is given by,
pH = pKa + log [Salt] / [Acid]
The pH of any acidic buffer solution is always less than 7 and the pH of any basic buffer solution is always greater than 7. 
Example 1
Determine the ratio of concentrations of Formate ion and formic acid in a buffer solution so that its pH is required to be 4? Identify the pH of this buffer to have the maximum buffer capacity? Ka of formic acid is 1.8 × 10-4.
Solution
We have the equation
pH = pKa + log[Salt] / [Acid]
4 = &#8211; log(1.8 × 10-4) + log[Formate] / [Formic acid]
4 = 3.74 + log [Formate] / [Formic acid]
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">log[Formate] / [Formic acid]
 = 4 &#8211; 3.74 = 0.26
[Formate] / [Formic acid]= 1.8
The buffer capacity would be maximum near the pKa of the acid.
For maximum buffer capacity
pH = pKa = -logKa
= -log(1.8 × 10-4) 
= 3.74
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">buffer capacity = 3.74
Example 2
Calculate the volume of 0.2M solution of acetic acid that needs to be added to 100ml of 0.2M solution of sodium acetate to obtain a buffer solution of pH 5.00. pKa of acetic acid is 4.74.
Solution
We have the equation,
pH = pKa + log[Salt] / [Acid]
log[Salt] / [Acid] = pH &#8211; pKa
= 5 &#8211; 4.74
 = 0.26
[Salt] / [Acid] = 1.82
Number of moles of sodium acetate
= 100×0.2 / 1000
 = 0.02 mol
Let volume of 0.2M acetic acid added = V mL
Number of moles of acetic acid = V×0.2 / 1000
0.02 / V× 0.2/1000 = 1.82
Therefore, 
V = 0.02×1000 / 0.2×1.82
= 55 mL
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">55 mL of acetic acid is added

Water in a hydraulic system exhibits two types of energy – kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy when water is in motion and potential is when there is water pressure. The sum of both kinetic and potential forms is the total energy of water. According to Bernoulli’s principle, the total energy of the liquid remains constant and hence when water flow in a system increases, the pressure must decrease.
Bernoulli&#8217;s principle states that for an inviscid flow of a nonconducting fluid, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or decrease in the potential energy. Bernoulli&#8217;s principle can be applied to various types of liquid flow, resulting in what is denoted as Bernoulli&#8217;s equation. The simple form of Bernoulli&#8217;s principle is applicable for incompressible flows.
The Bernoulli’s equation formula is given by
E = Z+ P / W + V2 / 2g
where,
E denotes total energy
 z is the height of the water
 P means pressure 
w is the unit weight of water
 V indicates flow velocity
g is acceleration due to gravity
Example 1
A pipe has an internal diameter of 2.2 cm and pressure of 2.5 x 105 Pa supplies water into a house. Calculate the pressure of flow in the pipe which enters with an inlet pipe diameter of 1.5 cm at a height of 5m above ground. The inlet pipe flow speed is 1.8 m / s.
Solution
v2 =a1v1 / a2 or (pie) ∗ (1.1)2
 = 2.178 / 0. 5625
=3.872 m/s
P2 = 2.5∗105 Pa – 1/2[1∗103 kg/m3] [14.99 − 3.24] – [1 * 103] [9.8] [5]
P2= (2.5 x 105) – (5.88 x 103) – (49 x 103)Pa
P2 = 1.95 * 105 Pa

All the bodies have a point where its total mass is concentrated, and we can lift it by applying force on that particular point.
Center of mass is the unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero or the point where if a force is applied causes it to move in the direction of strength. 
Center of Mass refers to a point where whole body&#8217;s mass is concentrated.
If there are two masses (m1, m2) separated by distances x1 and x2 from a fixed point. The Center of Mass (X) is expressed by
uRLStringLine "X\, =\, \frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}" width="151" height="39" 
If there are n number of masses (m1, m2,..mn) having distances x1, x2,&#8230;&#8230;xn then the Center of mass (X) is expressed by
uRLStringLine "X\, =\, \frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}+.......+m_{n}x_{n}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+.......+m_{n}}\, =\, \frac{\Sigma m_{i}x_{i}}{\Sigma m_{i}}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}+.......+m_{n}x_{n}}{m_{1}+m_{2}+.......+m_{n}}\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{\Sigma&amp;space;m_{i}x_{i}}{\Sigma&amp;space;m_{i}}" width="357" height="40" 
Center of Mass Formula is used to find the center of mass of any given number of bodies when their respective masses and distances are known. Center of mass is expressed in meters (m) because we are finding the distance where the center of mass is located. 
Example 1
Determine the Center of the mass of the two bodies having weights of 2 Kg and 3kg separated by the distance of 10 cm.
Solution
Given parameters are
 m1 = 2 Kg, 
 m2 = 3 Kg,
  x1 = 0 m, 
     x2 = 0.10 m.
The Center of mass formula is expressed as
  X = m1x1+m2x2 / m1+m2
= 2×0 + 3×10 / 2 + 3 
 = 30 / 5
 = 6 cm.
Example 2
Calculate the Center of the mass of the system having masses 7 Kg, 4 Kg and 3 Kg along the x-axis having distance 5 cm, 6 cm, and 8 cm?
Solution
Given parameters are
 m1 = 7 Kg
 m2 = 3 Kg
 m3 = 4 Kg 
 x1 = 5 cm
 x2 = 6 cm
 x3 = 8 cm 
The Center of mass is expressed by X
= m1x1+m2x2+m3x3 / m1+m2+m3
 = 7×5+3×6+4×8 / 7+3+4
6.071 cm

Capacitive Reactance Formula
Capacitive reactance ( X<sub>C</sub>) is a measure of a capacitor&#8217;s opposition to alternating current. It is measured in ohms like resistance but reactance is more complex than resistance because its value depends on frequency (f) of the electrical signal passing through the capacitor.
A Capacitor is a current storing device. In electrical and electronic systems, reactance is all about the opposition of a circuit element to changes in current or voltage due to that element&#8217;s capacitance.
When the capacitor is connected to a DC supply voltage, it becomes charged to the value of the applied voltage, acts as a temporary storage device and maintains this charge as long as the supply voltage is present.
Capacitive Reactance Formula is expressed by

xc = 1 / 2&pi;fc
xc = 1 / 2 &pi; x 200 x 1000 x 10^-3

The movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along its circular path is known as circular motion. It may be uniform and exhibit a constant angular rate of rotation and speed, or non-uniform with changing rate of rotation.
Rotating around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The motion equation describes the movement of the center of mass of a body.  Objects moving in circles possess a speed which is equal to the distance traveled per time of travel. By multiplying the rotational frequency with the circumference we can determine the average speed of the object.
The circular velocity formula is expressed as,

Critical Angle Formula
Critical Angle can be described as the angle of incidence that offers an angle of refraction of 90 degrees. Remember that the critical angle is defined as an angle of incidence value. The critical angle will be 48-6-degrees for water-air boundaries and 61.0-degrees for crown glass-water boundary.
The real value of the critical angle depends completely on the combination of materials that are available on each side of the boundary. Let us consider two different medium
Critical angle = Θi that gives a Θr value of 90-degrees
According to Snell’s Law equation, a generic equation for finding the critical angle can be derived easily.
ni *• sine(Θi) = nr • sine (Θr)
ni • sine(Θcrit) = nr • sine(90 degrees)
ni • sine(Θcrit) = nr
sine(Θcrit) = nr/ni
Θcrit= sine-1 (nr/ni) = invsine (nr/ni)
Solved Examples

Problem 1: 4.409g sample of propane was burned along with excess oxygen in the bomb calorimeter. The temperature of the calorimeter raised by 6.85oC. Find how much energy of heat is released per mole of propane burned under these conditions.
Answer :
Molar mass of propane (C3H8) = 44.09g/mol.
This enables us to find out the number of moles of propane burned and therefore the amount of energy released. We need to use the heat capacity of the calorimeter to correct the effect of the calorimeter.
Moles C3H8 = 4.409g C3H8 &times;&times; 1mol C3H844.09g C3H81mol C3H844.09g C3H8 = 0.1000 mol C3H8
Energy change per mole C3H8 = 32.4KJC32.4KJC &times;&times; 6.85oC &times;&times; 10.1000mol C3H810.1000mol C3H8

We add a negative sign to the values because energy is released from this reaction, where the reaction is exothermic.
Problem 2: What quantity of ice at 0oC can be melted by 100J of heat?
Solution:
Heat to fuse a substance = heat of fusion of the substance &times;&times; mass of the substance.
This can be expressed by the following formula where q is used to denote heat measurement made in a calorimeter.
q = m (mass) &times;&times; C (heat of fusion)
Solving for m we get
m = qCqC
  = 100J/3.34 &times;&times; 102J/g
  = 29.9 &times;&times; 10-2g or 0.299g of ice melted
Because heat is absorbed in this melting this is an endothermic reaction.

According to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy of an isolated system remains conserved over time. In this definition, the isolated system refers to as a thermodynamic system so designed that no matter or energy can pass through it.    
The statement of conservation of energy can be written as,
Energy spent in one act = Energy gained in the related act
For a given system, we can write,
\(E_{in}\;-\;E_{out}=\Delta E_{sys}\)
As we know, the net amount of energy transfer into or out of any system occurs in the form of heat (Q), mass (m) and work (W). Hence, we can rewrite the aforementioned equation as:
\(E_{in}\;-\;E_{out}=Q\;-\;W\)
Upon dividing all the terms on both sides of the equation by the mass of the system, the equation represents the law of conservation of energy on a unit mass basis, as shown below:
\(Q\;-\;W=\Delta u\)
Thus, we can write the conservation of energy rate equation as:
\(Q\;-\;W=\frac{dU}{dt}\)
We can take the example of a wind mill. The mechanical energy of wind rotates the turbines of a wind mill, which in turn rotate the shaft of an electric generator, thus generating electrical energy. Here, we observe that the mechanical energy of wind gets converted into electrical energy. 
Problem: </b>The initial energy and the final energy of a system can be given by 2.95 × 10-3 and 5.86 × 10-3 respectively. Find the energy conservation of the system.
Solution:</b>
We can use the following formula to compute the energy conservation of the system:
\(\Delta E_{sys}=E_{in}-E_{out}\)
\(\Delta E=(5.83\times 10^{-3})-\left ( 2.95\times 10^{3} \right )\)
\(Thus, \Delta E=2.91\times 10^{-3}\)
Problem: </b>A particle of charge equal to that of electron and the charge is 1.67 × 10-27 and mass of the particle is 1.30 × 10-27 kg. Compute the law of conservation of energy.
Solution:</b>
As per the law of conservation of energy formula, we have:
\(Q-W=\Delta E_{sys}\)
\(Or\Delta E_{sys}=Q-W=\left ( 1.67\times 10^{27} \right )-\left ( 1.30\times 10^{27} \right )=0.37\times 10^{27}\)

Doppler Shift Formula
A Doppler shift is a phenomenon of a change in frequency based on the observers point of view. The most common analogy of this is standing on the side of the road and listen to a passing car. As the car approaches, there is a definitive sound. As the car passes, the sound changes to a lower frequency. This is called a Doppler Shift. There are two types of Doppler shifts:
Anything that emits wavelengths &#8211; light, radio, gamma rays, and the rest of the E-M Band &#8211; and changes frequency due to movement, a Doppler shift can be measured. This is the equation:
uRLStringLine title="\frac{\Delta \lambda }{\lambda _{0}}=\frac{v}{c}" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\Delta&amp;space;\lambda&amp;space;}{\lambda&amp;space;_{0}}=\frac{v}{c}" 
uRLStringLine title="\Delta \lambda =wave\,length\, shift" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Delta&amp;space;\lambda&amp;space;=wave\,length\,&amp;space;shift" 
Question 1: A source and listener are moving towards each other with the speed of 54 km/hr. If the true frequency of sound emitted by the source is 500 Hz, calculate the observed frequency when both source and listener are moving towards each other.
Velocity of sound in air = 330 ms^-1.
Solution:
Given: True frequency, f = 500 Hz,
Velocity of sound, v<sub>s</sub> = 54 km/hr = 54×1000360054×10003600 = 15 ms^-1,
Source and observer moving towards each other
∴∴ Apparent frequency is given by f&#8217; = v+vov−vsv+vov−vs f
= 330+15330−15330+15330−15 ×× 500
= 547.62 Hz.
Question 2: A fixed source emits sound of frequency 1000 Hz. What is the frequency as heard by a observer
(i) at rest
(ii) Moving towards the source at a constant speed of 20 ms^-1 and
(iii) Moving away from the source at the same rate.
Solution:
Velocity of sound in air, v = 340 ms^-1,
True frequency, f = 1000 Hz,
Velocity of observer, v<sub>o </sub>= 20 ms^-1
(i) When both the source and observer are at rest, apparent frequency is same as true frequency
∴∴ Frequency as heard by listener at rest = f = 1000 Hz
(ii) Observer is moving towards the source
∴∴ Apparent frequency f<sub>1</sub> = v+vovv+vov f
= 340+20340340+20340 ×× 1000
= 1059 Hz
(iii) Observer is moving away from the source
∴∴ Apparent frequency f<sub>2</sub> = v−vovv−vov f
= 340−20340340−20340 ×× 1000
= 941 Hz.

Velocity or Escape speed is the speed of a body at which the total of the kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy is zero. In a different sense, it can be described as the speed required to break the gravitational attraction. The formula for escape speed is articulated as,
\(v_{e}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}\)
Where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet and r is the distance from the center of gravity.
Escape Speed Solved Examples

Gravity Formula
Gravity also termed as gravitation, is a force that occurs among all material objects in the universe. For any two objects or units having non-zero mass, the force of gravity has a tendency to attract them toward each other. The Universal Law of Gravitation says that:
All mass applies an attractive force on all other mass.
If the distance between two masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> is d as shown in the diagram,
The gravity formula is articulated as

Flow Rate Formula
As we all know, liquids flow. One can say how slow or fast it flows. But can someone tell at what rate Fluid flows? To compute that let&#8217;s study the flow rate.The flow rate of a liquid is how much fluid passes through an area in a particular time. Flow rate can be articulated in either terms of velocity and cross-sectional area, or time and volume. As liquids are incompressible, the rate of flow into an area must be equivalent to the rate of flow out of an area. This is identified as the equation of continuity.
uRLStringLine src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Flow-Rate-Formula.jpg" alt="Flow Rate Formula" width="204" height="303" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5727" 
Flow rate is the quantity of fluid flowing in the specified time. It is expressed in liters per meter(lpm) or gallons per meter(gpm). It is articulated as

Where,<br the flow area is A and

uRLStringLine src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Q=\frac{C}{t}" title="Q=\frac{C}{t}" 
Where,<br the capacity of fluid stored is C and <br the time taken to flow is t

Gauss&#8217;s Law states that the total electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity. The electric flux in an area is defined as the electric field multiplied by the area of the surface projected in a plane and perpendicular to the field.
The electric field is the basic concept to know about electricity. Generally, the electric field of surface is calculated by applying coulomb&#8217;s law, but to calculate the electric field distribution in a closed surface, we need to understand the concept of Gauss law. It explains about the electric charge enclosed in a closed or the electric charge present in the enclosed closed surface. 
The total charge enclosed in a closed surface is proportional to the total flux enclosed by the surface. If ϕ is total flux and ϵ0 is electric constant, the total electric charge Q enclosed by the surface is
Q = ϕ ϵ0
The Gauss law formula is expressed by
ϕ = Q / ϵ0
Where, 
Q = total charge within the given surface,
ϵ0 = the electric constant.
Example 1
Find the total flux enclosed by the surface containing  three charges q1, q2, and q3 having charge 6 C, 5 C and 4 C
Solution:
Total charge,
Q = q1 + q2 + q3
    = 6 C + 5 C + 4 C
    = 15 C
The total flux is given by
ϕ = Q / ϵ0
ϕ = 15 C / 8.854×10−12
ϕ = 1.694 Nm2 / C−1
Therefore, ϕ =   1.694 Nm2 / C−1
Example 2
Calculate the electric flux in a cylinder of length 5 cm, radius 3 cm having electric field intensity 2 N/C.
Solution:
Given:
 Length l is 5 cm,
 Radius r is 3 cm,
 Electric field intensity is given by
 E = 2 N/C
Electric flux is given by
ϕ = E (2 ππ r l)
ϕ = 2 N/C (2 π × 0.03 m × 0.05 m)
ϕ = 0.0188 Nm2 / C−1

        = 1 + 3 + 2.5 × (-0.5) + (-0.25)(-1.5) 
        = (0.5)3 + 2(0.5)2 + 3(0.5) + 1 
        = 0.125 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 1 
Therefore, f(0.5) = 3.125

What is Heat of Vaporization ?
The Heat of Vaporization is the quantity of heat that needs to be absorbed to vaporize a particular quantity of liquid at a constant temperature. If the solutions of vapor and liquid states are compared, the kinetic energy of the steam is proved to be higher than the kinetic energy of the fluid.
In other words, the heat of vaporization is the amount of heat required to turn particular quantity of liquid into vapor without any rise in the temperature of the fluid. 
Heat of Vaporization Formula<br Based on entropy and enthalpy of vaporization and relationship among them, the Heat of vaporization formula can be written as
Hv = q / m<br Wherein,
Hv = heat of vaporization<br q =heat<br m = mass
Example1<br If the heat of vaporization for water is 2257 j/g, calculate the amount of heat energy that must be applied to vaporize 145 grams of water.<br Solution:<br The heat of vaporization equation can be rearranged to solve for q, i.e.,

 q = Hv x m

Heat is a form of energy and the power is the rate at which energy is used. The rate at which heat energy is utilized is measured in watts which can also be called as power loss. Heat gain via walls and roofs is affected by solar energy which is absorbed at the outer surface represented by the air temperature. It is the outdoor temperature which would generate the same heat gain through the element without solar energy since it exists with the actual air temperature. 
The heat gain formula is given by,
q = 1.10 &times; cfm &times; (to &#8211; ti)
Where, 
Example 1
Calculate the sensible heat gain for a ventilation flow rate of 9,000 cfm if the outside air temperature (to) is 88^∘F and the inside air temperature (ti) is 80^∘F.
Solution:
Given data:
cfm = 9000,
to = 88,
ti = 80.
Substitute in the given formula, we get
q = 1.10 &times; cfm &times; (to &#8211; ti)
q = 1.10 &times; 9000 &times; (88-80)
q = 110000
Therefore, the heat gain is 79200.
Example 2
Calculate the total heat gain due to the ventilation for 5000 cfm of air when the enthalpy of outside air is 35 and the enthalpy of the inside air is 30.0.
Solution:
Given data:
cfm = 5000,
toto = 35,
titi = 30.
Substitute in the corresponding formula,
q = 1.10 &times; cfm &times; (to &#8211; ti)
q = 1.10 &times; 5000 &times; (35 &#8211; 30)
q = 27500

Heat Load Formula
The heating load is the amount of heat energy required to be added to a specific space to maintain the temperature in an acceptable range. The cooling load is the amount of heat energy required to be removed from the space to keep the temperature in an acceptable range.
Heat sources are considered to be two types, one resulting in an internal heat load on the conditional space and those resulting in an external heat load.
Those belonging to the external heat load category are a source of load on the indoor equipment, but do not affect the air it has passed through the equipment. 
Heat sources which result to an internal heat like heat conduction through the glass, walls, etc. Heat sources which result in an external heat load, heat from any source added in the air after it leaves a space. 
The heat load formula is given as,
Heat load = Q = m &times; Cp &times;&Delta;T
Where,
Q = Heat load,
m = mass flow rate,
Cp = specific heat,
&Delta;T = change in temperature.
Example 1
Determine the heat load in the electric convector in which the rate of mass flow is 5.45 and Cp is 1000 and the enthalpy is from 21.5 to 26.55.
Solution:
Given: 
M = 4.45, 
Cp = 1000, 
T1 = 26.55, 
T2 = 21.5
Substituting in the formula,
Heat load , Q = m &times;Cp &times;&Delta;T

The continuous compounding formula is used to determine the interest earned on an account that is constantly compounded, necessarily leading to an infinite amount of compounding periods.
The effect of compounding is earning interest on investment, or at times paying interest on debt, that is reinvested to earn additional monies that would not have been gained based on the principal balance alone. By earning interest on prior interest, one can earn at an exponential rate.
The continuous compounding formula takes this effect of compounding to the furthest limit. Instead of compounding interest on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, continuous compounding will efficiently reinvest gains perpetually.
\[\LARGE A=Pe^{rt}\]
Where,
Use the continuous compound interest formula,
Given,
Here: <em>e</em> stands for the Napier&#8217;s number, which is approximately 2.7183.
However, one does not have to plug this value in the formula, as the calculator has a built-in key for e. Therefore,
$A=2340\;e^{0.031(3)}\approx 2568.06$
So, the balance after 3 years is approximately Rs. 2,568.06.

Doppler Effect defines the apparent change in the frequency of sound when the observer and the medium both are in relative motion. It&#8217;s a wave phenomenon which holds not just for sound waves but also for electromagnetic waves like microwaves, visible light, and microwaves. It depends on three factors &#8211; Velocity of the source, Velocity of the medium and Velocity of the observer.
Solved Examples 
Question:
A Submarine travels through water at a speed of 8.00 m/s, emitting a sonar wave at a frequency of 1400 Hz. The speed of sound in the water is 530 m/s. A second submarine is located such that both submarines are traveling directly towards each other. The second submarine is moving at 6.00 m/s.
(A) What is the frequency detected by an observer riding on second submarine as the first submarine approaches it?
(B) The submarine barely miss each other and pass. What frequency is detected by an observer riding on second submarine as the subs recede from it?
(C) When both the submarine approaches each other, some of the sound from first submarine reflects from second submarine and returns to it. If the sound were to be detected by an first submarine, what is its frequency?
Solution:
Given: Frequency f = 1400 Hz,
Velocity of Source, V<sub>s</sub> = 8 m/s,
Velocity of Screen, V<sub>o</sub> = 6 m/s.
(A) The Apparent frequency is given by,
f &#8216; = v+v0v−vsv+v0v−vs
f &#8216; = 530m/s+(+6.00)m/s530m/s−(+8.00m/s)530m/s+(+6.00)m/s530m/s−(+8.00m/s) (1400 Hz)
f &#8216; = 1437.54 Hz.
(B) To find Doppler-shifted frequency heard by the observer in second submarine:
f &#8216; = v+v0v−vsv+v0v−vs
f &#8216; = 530m/s+6m/s530m/s−(−8m/s)530m/s+6m/s530m/s−(−8m/s) (1400 Hz)
f &#8216; = 1394.79 Hz.
(C)The Sound of apparent frequency 1436.5 Hz found in part (A) is reflected from a moving source (sub B) and detected by a moving observer
f = 530m/s+(+8m/s)530m/s−(+9m/s)530m/s+(+8m/s)530m/s−(+9m/s) (1416 Hz)
f = 1432 Hz.

Solved Examples
Problem 1: The path distance from garden to a school is 5m west and then 4m south. A builder wants to build a short distance path for it. Find
Solution:
Given: Distance to the west x = 5m
Distance to the south y = 4m.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter wp-image-5405 size-full" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Distance-to-the-south.jpg" alt="Distance to the south" width="221" height="151" 

Displacement is given by S = x2+y2−−−−−−√x2+y2
= 52+42−−−−−−√52+42
= 6.70 m.
The builder can build a path for displacement length of 6.7 m.
Question 2: A girl walks from the corridor to the gate she moves 3m to the north opposite from her house then takes a left turn and walks for 5m. then she takes right turn and moves for 6m and reaches the gate. What is the displacement, magnitude, and distance covered by her?
Solution:
Total distance traveled d = 3m + 5m + 6m = 14m. 
A magnitude of the displacement can be obtained by visualizing the walking :The actual path from A to B as 3m then from B to D as 5m and finally from D to E as 6m.

SSo, the magnitude of resultant displacement is |S| = AC2+CE2−−−−−−−−−−√AC2+CE2
From figure AC = AB + BC = 3m + 6m = 9m
BD = CE = 5m
|S| = 92+52−−−−−−√92+52 = 10.29 m.
The direction of Resultant displacement is South East.

Dynamic Viscosity Formula for a fluid defines its internal resistance to flow due to some shearing force. A tangential force which acts when one horizontal plane moves with another one. The viscosity acts an important fluid property while analyzing the liquid behaviour and fluid motion near solid boundaries.
Formula for Dynamic Viscosity
T = &mu;&mu; uyuy.
Where,
u= shear velocity (m/s),
y= distance between the layers,
T =shearing stress,
&mu;&mu; = dynamic viscosity (Ns/m22).
The SI unit for Dynamic Viscosity = Ns/m22, Pa s or kg/ms.
Question 1: A fluid is flowing between two layers. Find the shearing force if the shear velocity is 0.25 m/s and has length 2 m and dynamic viscosity is 2Ns/m22.
Solution:
Given:
Shear velocity u = 0.25 m/s,
shear stress y = 0.125/s
dynamic viscosity &mu;&mu; = 2 Ns/m^2
The shearing stress is given by,
F = &mu;&mu; A uyuy
F = 2 Ns/m22 &times;&times; 0.125 /s
F = 0.5 N/m22
Therefore, the shearing stress is 0.5 N/m22.
Question 2: A fluid moves along length 0.75 m with velocity 2m/s and has shearing stress of 2 N/m22. Find its dynamic viscosity.
Solution:
Given: Shear velocity u = 2m/s, length y = 0.75 m, shearing stress T = 2 N/m22
The shearing stress is given by,
T = &mu;&mu; uyuy.
&mu;&mu; = T yuyu
&mu;&mu; = 2 N/m22 &times;&times; 0.375 m/s
&mu;&mu; = 0.75 Ns/m22.
Therefore, the dynamic viscosity = 0.75 Ns/m22.

In brief Force can be described as the exterior agency which makes the body change its state, size, position under strain. It is represented by F.
Commonly, the formula for force is articulated by
F = m × a
Where,
Acceleration a is given by
a = v/t
Where v = Velocity and
So Force can be ariculated as
F = mv/t
Inertia formula is termed as p = mv which can also be articulated as Momentum
Therefore, Force can be articulated as the rate of change of momentum.
F = p/t = dp/dt
Force formulas are beneficial in finding out the force, mass, acceleration, momentum, velocity in any given problem.
Force Problems
Questions based on the force which may be helpful are provided underneath:
Solved Samples
Problem 1: Aimee has a toy car of mass 2kg. How much force should she apply on the car so that it should travel with the acceleration of 8m/s^2?
m (Mass of toy car) = 2 Kg,
Problem 2: A hammer having a mass of 1 kg going with a speed of 6 m/s hits a wall and comes to rest in 0.1 sec. Compute the obstacle force that makes the hammer stop?
Given: Mass of Hammer, m = 1 kg
Initial Velocity, u = 6 m/s,
Final Velocity, v = 0 m/s,
Time Taken, t = 0.1 s.
The acceleration is, a = (v &#8211; u)/t
Therefore, a =  -60 \(m/s^{2}\) [-ve sign indicates retardation]
Thus the retarding Force, F = ma = 1 × 60 = 60N

Friction is the resistance required for moving a body through an external surface. But the friction loss is connected to the flow of liquid through a pipe. In other sense, it is a kind of energy loss because of the friction inside the tube. It is intimately related to the velocity and viscosity of the fluid.

Hooke&#8217;s law states that the force required to extend or compress a spring by some distance is directly proportional to that distance. The stiffness of the spring is a constant factor characteristic. The property of elasticity states that it takes twice the much force to stretch a spring twice as long. This linear dependence of displacement on stretching is known as Hooke’s law. This law is named after 17^th century British physicist Robert Hooke.
It says that the amount of stress we apply on any object, that amount of stress is observed on it, which means Stress ∝ Strain.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5539" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hookes-Law.jpg" alt="Hooke's Law" width="338" height="256" 
Hooke&#8217;s Law Formula is given as
F = -K x
Where,
F = amount of force applied in N,
x = displacement in the spring in m,
k = spring constant or force constant.
Hooke&#8217;s law formula can be applied to determine the force constant, displacement and force in a stretched spring.
Example 1
A spring is stretched by 10 cm and has a force constant of 2 cm /dyne. Determine the Force applied.
Solution:

Force constant k is 2 cm/dyne,
Extension x = 10 cm.
The force applied formula is given by
F = &#8211; k x
= &#8211; 2 × 10 cm
= &#8211; 20 cm/dyne
Example 2
Determine the force constant if a force of 100 N is stretching a spring by 0.8 m.
Solution:
Given parameters are
Force F = 100 N,
Extension, x = 0.2 m.
the force constant formula is given by
k = &#8211; F / x

Heat of Hydration Formula
Heat of hydration is defined as the amount of energy released when one mole of ions undergo hydration. It is a special type of dissolution energy where in the solvent is water.
The enthalpy of a hydrated salt is the change in heat, when 1 mole of an anhydrous substance combines with requisite number of water molecules to form the hydrate. The heat of hydration can be determined if the heat of the solutions of anhydrous salt and the hydrated forms are known.
Anhydrous salts readily combine with water to form hydrates and dissolve with the evolution of heat. The only difference between hydrate and anhydrous salt is the heat is evolved as heat of hydration in the formation of hydrates. 
The heat of hydration formula is given by:
Heat of hydration = &Delta;H solution &ndash; &Delta;H lattice energy
Where,
&Delta;H solution = Heat of the solution
&Delta;H lattice energy = Lattice energy of the solution
Example 1
The heat of solution of anhydrous and hydrated copper sulphate are &#8211; 65 and lattice energy is 11 KJ respectively. Determine the heat of hydration.
Solution:
Given parameters are
Heat of solution = &#8211; 65
Lattice energy = 11 KJ
Substitute the values in the given formula,
Heat of hydration = &Delta;Hsolution &#8211; &Delta;Hlattice energy
   = &#8211; 65 &#8211; 11
Heat of hydration = -56
Example 2
The lattice enthalpy of sodium chloride &Delta;H for NaCl &rarr;&rarr; Na+ + Cl&#8211; is 700 kJ/mol. The heat of solution in making up 1 M NaCl is +5.0kJ/mol. Determine the heat of hydration of Na+ and Cl&#8211;, where the heat of hydration of Cl&#8211; is -300kJ/mol.
Solution:
Given data,
Lattice energy = 700 kJ/mol
Heat of solution = 5.0kJ/mol
Substitute the values in the given formula,
Heat of hydration = &Delta;Hsolution &#8211; &Delta;Hlattice energy
             = 5 &#8211; 700
Therefore, Heat of hydration = -695
Heat of hydration of Na+ + Cl&#8211; = -695
Heat of hydration of Na+ = -695 &#8211; (-300)
Therefore, Heat of hydration of Na+ = -395

Heat Input Formula
Under arc welding process, heat input and arc energy are the measures of energy that has been supplied to the piece to form a weld. Both are measured in units of energy per unit length.<br It refers to a characteristic or dimension such as weld length, a bead, the diameter of a weld spot or cross section. The amount of heat input which goes into a weld is determined as a function of time.
The heat input formula is given by, <br Heat input = Voltage(V) &times; current(A) x time / distance travelled&times;1000
The accurate measurement of arc voltage is the difficulty here, but we mostly measure load voltage at the output terminals of the current source.
Example1<br Determine the heat input of the engine which operates in 2000 V with a current of 5500 calories. The distance is 10 ft with time 40 sec.
Solution:<br Given data parameters are
Voltage = 2000 V<br Current (A) = 5500<br Distance travelled = 10 ft<br Time = 40 sec
Substitute all the values in the given formula.
Heat input = Voltage &times; current &times; time / distance travelled &times; 1000
= 2000&times;5500&times;40 / 10 &times;1000
Therefore, Heat input = 44000 Joules / ft.
Example 2<br A heat engine operates at a voltage of 1500 V with a current of 3400 A. Determine the heat input if the distance is 24 ft with time 80 sec.
Solution:<br Given parameters are<br Voltage = 1500 V<br Current (A) = 3400 A<br Distance = 24 ft<br Time = 80 sec
Substitute all the values in the given formula.
Heat input = Voltage &times; current &times;time / distance travelled&times;1000
= 1500 &times; 3400 &times; 80 / 24 x 1000<br  Therefore, Heat input = 17000 joules / ft.

Heat Rate Formula
The heat rate is the amount of energy required by an electrical generator or a power plant to produce one kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity.
It is the rate of heat input required to generate unit power. Heat rate can also be defined as the ratio between thermal power inputs to electrical power output. If the heat rate is low, the efficiency is higher. In thermal generating units, the input and output exists normally in same units. In other words, heat range is equal to chemical energy input divided by the electrical energy released.
The heat rate formula is given by,
Rh = Ws &times; c &times; &Delta;T
Where,
Rh is heat rate in btu/hr,
Ws is steam flow in lb/hr,
c = specific heat capacity in btu/lb ∘F,
&Delta;T is the temperature difference in ∘F.
Question 1: Calculate the heat rate if steam enters a turbine at 400oF at atmospheric pressure. Steam at 500 lb flows through the turbine each hour during normal operation.
Solution:
Given parameters are,
Ws = 500 lbs/hr
c = 0.48
Tin = 400oF
Tout = 200oF
&Delta;T = 400 &#8211; 200
  = 200oF
We have the Formula,
Rh = Ws &times; c &times;&Delta;T
 = 500 &times; 0.48 &times; 200
  Therefore, Rh = 48000 btu/hr
Example 2
Determine the horsepower output by using the heat rate value in the question 2 above.
Solution:
Horsepower can be calculated by,
HP = heat rate &times; 0.000393.
 = 48000 &times; 0.000393
Therefore, HP= 18.864

The property of a conductor by which an alteration in current passing through it creates (induces) voltage or electromotive force in any nearby conductors (mutual inductance) and in both the conductor itself (self-inductance) is termed as Inductance.  Inductance is described as opposing of changes of current. The inductance value is represented as L and its unit is Henry. One Henry value is equivalent to the induced one volt by changing of current in one ampere per second in an inductance value. The inductance value is of two types. One is mutual inductance and another one is self-inductance. Let us see the applications of inductance value.

Equivalent Resistance Formula
Equivalent resistance is where the aggregate resistance connected either in parallel or series is calculated. Essentially, the circuit is designed either in Series or Parallel.Electrical resistance shows how much energy one needs when you move the charges/current through your devices. If you require lots of energy, then the resistance necessary is also high. The equivalent resistance of a network is that single resistor that could replace the entire network in such a way that for a certain applied voltage V you get the same current I as you were getting for a network.
Equivalent resistance formula for series resistance is given by,

The rate of change at one known instant is the Instantaneous rate of change, and it is equivalent to the value of the derivative at that specific point. So it can be said that, in a function, the slope, m of the tangent is equivalent to the instantaneous rate of change at a specific point. One more method to comprehend this concept clearly is with the difference quotient and limits. The average rate of change of y with respect to x is the difference quotient. Now if one looks at the difference quotient and lets Delta x-&gt;0, this will be the instantaneous rate of change. In guileless words, the time interval gets lesser and lesser.

Fluid Mechanics Formula
Fluid mechanicscould be defined as the division of engineering science which deals with the fluids behavior in both motion and rest situations.
Fluid mechanics is one of the four divisions of mechanics namely quantum mechanics, relative mechanism, fluid mechanics and elastic body mechanics.
Fluid mechanics is separated into three distinct classes. These are statics, kinematics, and the dynamics out of which static and dynamics are then divided into compressible and incompressible flow. These are furthermore split into turbulent and laminar forms.
Fluid mechanics is grounded upon five great principles of physics and they are as follows:
In fluid mechanics if the speed of flow of a liquid if not too huge then it generally flows in coats with regular gradation in their respective velocities and therefore calledstreamlineflow. While if the rate of flow is too high then numerous irregularities begin to show and do not flow in layers which we term asturbulentflow. The turbulence commences after the critical velocity which is given by a relation
uRLStringLine src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_{c}=\frac{k\eta}{\rho&space;r}" title="V_{c}=\frac{k\eta}{\rho r}" 
Solved Example
Some Examples on Fluid Mechanics Formula are:

Answer:
Transforming every unit into meters.
Distance in the middle of the pistons = 0.015&times;10^-3m or 0.015 mm
The speed of the pistons at which they travel = 0.35 m/s or 35 cm/s
Force in the middle of the two pistons = 1.2 N / m^2

What is escape velocity?
Escape Velocity is the minimum velocity required by a body to be projected overcome the gravitational pull of the earth. It is the minimum velocity required by an object to escape the gravitational field that is, escape the land without ever falling back. An object that has this velocity at the earth’s surface will totally escape the earth&#8217;s gravitational field ignoring the losses due to the atmosphere.
For example, a spacecraft leaving the surface of Earth needs to go at 7 miles per second, or around 25,000 miles per hour to leave without falling back to the surface.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter wp-image-5473 size-full" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Escape-Velocity-Formula.jpg" alt="Escape Velocity Formula" width="345" height="224"

Wherein,
Vesc = escape velocity,
G = gravitational constant is 6.673 × 10-11m3kg-1s-2,
M = mass of the planet,

uRLStringLine "V_{esc}\, =\,\sqrt{2gR}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?V_{esc}\,&amp;space;=\,\sqrt{2gR}" width="110" height="23" 
It is expressed in m/s and escape velocity of earth is 11,200 m/s.
Escape velocity formula is applied in finding escape velocity of anybody or planet, if mass and radius is known.
Example 1

Viscosity is a concept where fluid shows struggle against flowing, which is being distorted due to extensional stress forces or shear stress. Kinematic viscosity is the sort which is computed by calculating the ratio of the fluid mass density to the dynamic fluid, viscosity or absolute fluid viscosity. It is from time to time known as momentum diffusivity. The units of kinematic viscosity are established on time and area. It is the ratio of the area of time; henceforth it is m22/s or ft22/s.
The kinematic viscosity formula is articulated by,
ν = μρ

Any object placed in the field of gravitational pull of the Earth experiences gravitational force. Gravitational acceleration is defined as the acceleration gained by an object because of the force of gravity acting on it. It is represented by ‘g’ and is measured in terms of m/s2. Gravitational acceleration is a vector quantity, that is, it possesses both magnitude as well as direction. 
Formula: The gravitational acceleration acting on any object can be given using the following equation,  \(g = GM/ (r + h)^{2}\)
Here, G is the universal gravitational constant whose value is fixed and is equal to 6.673×10-11 N.m2/Kg2, M is the mass of the body whose gravitational pull is acting on the object under consideration, r is the radius of the planet and h is the height of the object from the surface of the body. 
When the object is on or near the surface of the body, the force of gravity acting on the object is almost constant and the following equation can be used. 
\(g = GM/ r^{2}\)
Derivation:
From the Newton’s Second Law of Motion, we can write 
F=ma
Here, F is the force acting on the object, m is its mass and ‘a’ is the acceleration. 
Also, as per Newton’s Law of Gravity, we can write, 
\(F_{g} = GMm / (r + h)^{2}\)
It is the gravitational force acting between two bodies lying in the gravitational field of each other. This force acts inwards and is attractive in nature. Each of the two bodies experience the same force directed towards the other. 
Using the Newton’s second law of motion, in order to find the acceleration of the body under this condition,
\(a = F_{g}/m\)
Here, m is the mass of the object for which the gravitational acceleration is to be calculated. 
\(a = g = GMm / (r + h)^{2}m\)

\(g = GM/ (r + h)^{2}\)
Also, when the object is on or near to the surface the value of g becomes constant and does not change considerably with the height. Hence, we can write, 
\(g = gM/r^{2}\)

Real Life examples: Let us consider a satellite that has to revolve in the upper part of the atmosphere surrounding the Earth. In order to calculate the velocity with which it has to move so as to remain in its path, we must know the gravitational acceleration acting on the object. 
Solved examples </b>
Example 1:
Calculate the acceleration due to gravity for an object placed at the surface of the Earth, given that, the radius of the Moon is 1.74 × 106 m and its mass is 7.35 × 1022 kg. 
Solution: 
As given in the question, the radius of the moon, r = 1.74 × 106m = 1740000 m. 
Also, the mass of moon = 7.35 × 1022 kg
Using the formula for acceleration due to gravity, we write, 
\(g = GM/ r^{2}\)

Upon substituting the values, we get, 
\(g = (6.673 * 10^{-11})(7.35* 10^{22})/1740000\)
\(g = 1.620 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\)
The acceleration due to gravity is calculated to be 1.620 m/s2. 
Example 2:
The radius of the Earth is 6.38 x 106 m. The mass of the Earth is 5.98x 1024 kg. If a satellite is orbiting the Earth 250 km above the surface, what acceleration due to gravity does it experience?
Solution:</b>
It can be seen that, the satellite is present at a considerable height from the surface of the Earth, hence the height cannot be neglected. Using the first formula, we can write, 
<i>R=r+h</i> = (6.38 x 106 m) + (250 km)
<i>R</i> = 6 380 000 + 250 000 m
<i>R</i> = 6 630 000 m
The acceleration due to gravity of the satellite can be found from the formula:
\(g = GM/ (r + h)^{2}\)
\(g = (6.673 * 10^{-11})(5.98* 10^{24})/(6630000)^{2}\)
\(g = 9.07 \frac{m}{s^{2}}\)

Lens maker formula is used to construct a lens with specified focal length. A lens has two curved surfaces, but both are not exactly same. If the refractive index and the radius of curvature of both the surface are known, you can determine the focal length of that particular lens by using the given lens maker’s formula,
uRLStringLine "\frac{1}{f}\, =\, \left ( \mu -1 \right )\left ( \frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}} \right )" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{1}{f}\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\left&amp;space;(&amp;space;\mu&amp;space;-1&amp;space;\right&amp;space;)\left&amp;space;(&amp;space;\frac{1}{R_{1}}-\frac{1}{R_{2}}&amp;space;\right&amp;space;)" width="196" height="45" 
Where,
 f = focal length of the lens,
 μ = refractive index of the material, 
R1 and R2 = radius of curvature of both surfaces.
Example 1:
Determine the focal length of the lens whose refractive index and radius of curvature of each surface are 2, 20cm and -35cm respectively.
Solution:
Given parameters are,
μ = 1,
R1 = 20 cm and R2 = -35cm
Lens maker&#8217;s formula is expressed by, 
1 / f = (μ−1) (1 / R1 &#8211; 1 / R2 )
  = 1 (1/20 + 1/35)
= 0.05 + 0.028
    = 0.078
So, f = 1 / 0.078
 = 12.82cm
Question 2: The refractive index of a lens is 2.5, and the two curved surfaces have a radius of curvature 10cm and -12cm respectively. Determine the focal length of the lens.
Solution:
Given parameters are,
μ = 2.5,
R1 = 10cm and R2 = -12cm
Lens maker&#8217;s formula is expressed by,
1 / f = (μ−1) (1 / R1 &#8211; 1 / R2)
1 / f = (2.5 -1) (1/10 + 1/12)
= 0.274
So, f = 1/ 0.274
       = 3.64 cm

According to newton’s law of motion, all moving bodies continue to be in the state of rest or motion unless interfered by some external force. The same principle can be applied to momentum i.e, if the mass and velocity of an object remains same, then the momentum of the object remains constant.
Momentum is associated with the mass of the moving body and can be defined as the quantity of motion measured as a product of mass and velocity.

Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy in an object that is used to do a particular work. In other words, it describes the energy of an object because of its motion or position, or both.  Potential energy is possessed by the object&#8217;s position whereas kinetic energy is possessed by the movement. When an object is moving, its potential energy is zero. When it’s at rest, the kinetic energy is zero.
The mechanical energy formula is given by,

M.E = K. E + P.E
M.E = ½ mv2 + mgh

Where, 
m = mass of an object,
v = velocity of that object,
g = acceleration due to gravity and 
h  =  height of an object.
Example 1
A person is sitting on a building of height 10m and the mass of the person is 50kg, determine the mechanical energy.

Solution:
Given parameters are,
m = 50 kg
h = 10m
the person is not moving, therefore, K. E = 0
Mechanical energy formula is given by,
Since K.E is 0, the equation becomes,
M.E = mgh
     = 50 ×9.81 ×10
     = 4905 J

Example 2
Determine the mechanical energy of a 20 kg object which is moving with a speed of 10m/s.

Solution:
Given parameters are,
m = 20kg
 v = 10m/s
 the person is moving, therefore P. E = 0
Mechanical energy formula is given by
Since P.E is 0, the equation becomes,
M.E = 1 / 2mv2
= 1 / 2 × 20 ×102
= 1000 J

Gravitational Force Formula
The universe has numerous forces, a lot of pushes and pulls. One is always pushing or pulling something, even if only the ground. In Physics, there are actually only four essential forces from which everything new is derived: the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, the strong force and the weak force.
 Newton&#8217;s law of gravity says that the gravitational force amidst two objects is proportionate to the result of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance amongst them. All bodies, counting you, are tugging on every other body in the whole universe! This is termed as Newton&#8217;s Universal Law of Gravitation.
 The universal law of gravitation states that:
Every object in the universe pulls every other object with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
TheGravitational force formulais given by

Magnetic force is the force of attraction or repulsion that arises between electrically charged particles due to their motion. It is the basic force responsible for effects like action of electric motors or attraction of iron pieces towards magnet.
In other words, magnetic force is the force experienced because of the magnetic field. It can be positive or negative depending whether the force is attractive or repulsive.
Magnetic force is based on the charge, velocity and magnetic field of the object.
The magnetic force formula is given by,
uRLStringLine title="F_{B}=qv\times B" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_{B}=qv\times&amp;space;B" alt="" 
uRLStringLine title="F_{B}=qvBsin\theta" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F_{B}=qvBsin\theta" alt="" 
Wherein,
FB = magnetic force,
q = charge,
v = velocity,
B = magnetic field and
θ = angle between the track of the second particle and direction of magnetic field.
Example1
Determine the magnetic force of a 5C charged particle moving with a velocity of 10m/s in a magnetic field of 1T. The direction of magnetic field is perpendicular to the track of the second particle.

Solution:
Given parameters are,
q = 5C,
 v = 10m/s,
B = 1T
Since the path of second particle is perpendicular magnetic field direction,
 θ = 90°
The magnetic force formula is given by,
FB = q v B sinθ
FBFB = 5 × 10 × 1 × sin 90
      = 50N

Example 2
Determine the magnetic force of 50C charged particle moving with a velocity of 3m/s in an magnetic field of 1T? The direction of magnetic field is same as path of the second particle.

Solution:
Given parameters are,
q = 50C,
v = 3m/s,
B = 1T
Since the path of second particle is same as magnetic field direction,
θ = 0°
The magnetic force formula is given by
FB = q v B sinθ
= 50 × 3 ×1 × sin 0

Momentum is the tendency of the object to be in motion and therefore is a vector quantity. It is determined by the product of the mass of the object and its velocity. If both the objects are not experiencing any external forces, then the total momentum of the objects before and after the interaction is the same. This relation under the fundamental law of physics is known as the conservation of momentum.
This fundamental law of physics can be applied to explain the phenomenon of collision and explosion.The momentum formula is given by,
Momentum (P) = mass (m) x velocity (v)
Conservation of momentum can be described by
P1 (before) + P2 (before) = P1 (after) + P2 (after)  
This equation is valid for the object that undergoes collision.
Example 1
A 0.55 Kg cricket ball moving at a speed of 3.5 m / s collides with a cricket bat of 3.5 Kg swung at a speed of 1.5 m / s. after the collision the cricket bat swings at a speed of 0.5 m / s. Calculate the magnitude and the velocity of the cricket ball.

Solution:
Given:
 m1 = 0.55 kg
 m2 = 3.5 kg
 v1 = 3.5 m/s
 v2 = 1.5 m/s
The relation between the colliding bodies is given by,
P1 ( before ) + P2 (before ) = P1 ( after ) + P2 ( after ) 
The momentum relation stands as,
 ( m1 v1 ) before + ( m2 v2 ) before = ( m1 v1 ) after + ( m2 v2 ) after
Therefore, v1 (after) = [(m1v1)before+(m2v2)before−(m2v2)after] / (m1)after
                = 0.5 x 3.5 + 3.5 x -1.5 – 3.5 x 0.5 / 0.55
               = 1.875 – 5.25 – 1.75 / 0.55
               = -9.318
Therefore, v1 (after) = &#8211; 9.31 m/s
 The negative sign shows that it travels in the opposite direction.

Example 1
A ball of 1 kg is moving at a speed of 5 m / s collides with a cricket bat of 2.5 Kg swung at a speed of 1.5 m / s. right after the collision the cricket bat swings at a speed of 1.5 m / s. Calculate the magnitude and the velocity of the cricket ball.
Solution:
Given:
 m1 = 1 kg
 m2 = 2.5 kg
 v1 = 5 m/s
 v2 = 1.5 m/s
The relation between the colliding bodies is given by,
P1 (before) + P2 (before ) = P1 ( after ) + P2 ( after ) 
The momentum relation is expressed by,
 (m1 v1) before + ( m2 v2 ) before = ( m1 v1 ) after + ( m2 v2 ) after
 v1 (after) = [(m1v1)before+(m2v2)before−(m2v2)after] / (m1)after
                               = 1 x 5 + 2.5 x -1.5 – 2.5 x 1.5 / 1
                               = -2.5
Therefore, v1 (after) = &#8211; 2.5 m/s
The negative sign shows that it travels in the opposite direction.

The normal force is the force component vertical to any contact surface. It decides the amount of force the body applies on the ground. The normal force will be the weight of the object only if the object is not accelerating (decelerating). When a object is about to fall, it depends on which position the object falls on the ground. It is denoted by F<sub>N</sub> and is given in newtons (N).
For a body resting on the flat surface the normal force FNN is equal to the weight,
F<sub>N</sub> = mg
Where,
gravitational force is g and
If a force acts on a dropping body that falls at an angle of θ the normal force is greater than the weight articulated as,
F<sub>N</sub> = mg + F sin θ

Where,
If a force tugs the body in the upward direction, the normal force is less than its weight and is given by,

Orbital velocity is the velocity at which a body revolves around the other body. Objects that travel in uniform circular motion around the Earth are called to be in orbit. The velocity of this orbit depends on the distance between the object and the center of the earth.
This velocity is usually given to the artificial satellites so that it revolves around any particular planet.
The orbital velocity formula is given by,
Vorbit = √GM / R
uRLStringLine "Vorbit\, =\, \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Vorbit\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}" width="137" height="45" 
It is given by
Where, 
G = gravitational constant,
M = mass of the body at center,
R = radius of orbit.
Orbital Velocity Formula is applied to calculate the orbital velocity of the any planet if mass M and radius R are known.
Orbital Velocity is expressed in meter per second (m/s).
Question 1:
Calculate the orbital velocity of earth so that the satellite revolves round the earth if radius of earth R = 6.5 × 106 m, mass of earth M = 5.5 × 1024 kg and Gravitational constant G = 6.67 × 10-11 m3/s2 kg.
Solution:
Given:
R = 6.5 × 106 m
M = 5.5 × 1024 kg
G = 6.6 × 10-11 m3/s2 kg
The Orbital velocity formula is given by 
Vorbit = √GM / R
        = √6.67 ×10−11 × 5.5×1024 / 6.5 ×106
       = √36.68 x 1013 / 6.5 x 106
        = 7.5 km/s
Example 2:
A satellite launch is made for the study of Jupiter.Determine its velocity so that it orbit round the Jupiter. 
Given: Radius of Jupiter R = 70.5 × 106 m, 
       Mass of jupiter M = 1.5 × 1027 Kg, 
       Gravitational constant G = 6.67 × 10-11 m3/s2 kg
Solution:
When the given parameters are substituted in the orbital velocity formula, we get
Vorbit = √GM / R
     = √6.673×10−11×1.5×1027 / 70.5×106
     = √10.0095 x 1016 / 70.5 x 106
     = √0.141 x 1010
      3.754 x 109 m/s.

Pressure drop describes the difference in the pressure between two points of a network carrying fluid. Pressure drop occurs when the frictional force caused by the resistance to flow acting on the fluid as it flows through the tube.  
It has a relation between viscosity and velocity of the liquid. The main factors that determine the resistance to the liquid flow are fluid velocity through the pipe and the fluid viscosity. Pressure drop is proportional to the frictional shear forces within the pipe network. 
The Pressure drop is denoted by J. 
The pressure drop formula is given by

A simple pendulum is a mechanical arrangement that demonstrates periodic motion. The simple pendulum comprises of a small bob of mass ‘m’ suspended by a thin string secured to a platform at its upper end of length L.
The string’s mass is thought of to be negligible paralleled to the mass of the bob and is disregarded. The bob when released from a specific height swings back and forth over the same path.
The pendulum bob travels along a circular arc instead of to and fro in a straight line. Though when the oscillations are minor, the motion of the bob is straight.
The restoring force that causes the pendulum to go through simple harmonic motion is essentially the gravitational force constituent which is tangent to the path of motion.
Frequency= 1T
The period of such pendulum is articulated as
 T = 2πLg−−√2πLg
Where, period of pendulum(seconds) = T
Length of the pendulum string (m) =L  And
acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2) = ‘g’

The Poiseuille’s law states that the flow of liquid depends on following factors like the pressure gradient (∆P), the length of the narrow tube (L) of radius (r) and the viscosity of the fluid (η) along with relationship among them.
The entire relation or the Poiseuille’s Law formula is given by,
Q = ΔPπr4 / 8ηl
Wherein,
The Pressure Gradient (∆P) : Shows the difference in the pressure between the two ends of the tube, determined by the fact any fluid will always flow from high pressure (p1) to low pressure region(p2) and the flow rate is determined by the pressure gradient (P1 – P2)
Radius of tube: The liquid flow varies directly with the radius to the power 4.
Viscosity (η): The flow of the fluid varies inversely with the viscosity of the fluid and as the viscosity of the fluid increases, the flow decreases vice versa.
Length of the Tube (L): The liquid flow is inversely proportional to the length of the tube, therefore longer the tube, greater is the resistance to the flow.
Resistance(R): The resistance is described by 8Ln / πr4 and therefore the Poiseuille’s law becomes
Q= (ΔP) R
Example 1:
The blood flow through a large artery of radius 2.5 mm is found to be 20 cm long. The pressure across the artery ends is 380 Pa, calculate the blood’s average speed.
Solution:
The blood viscosity η = 0.0027 N .s/m2
Radius = 2.5 mm
Difference of pressure = 380 Pa ( P1 – P2)
The average speed is given by, =
 380 x (0.0025)2 / 8(0.0027)(0.20m) 
The average speed becomes 1.6031 m / s
The water flow through a large tube of radius 3 mm is found to be 10 cm long. The pressure across the two ends of the tube is 300 Pa, calculate the water’s average speed.
Solution:
The viscosity η = 0.0027 N .s/m2
Radius = 3 mm
Difference of pressure = 300 Pa ( P1 – P2)
The average speed is given by, =
 300 x (0.0003)2 / 8(0.0027)(0.10m) 
The average speed becomes 0.911 m / s

Reynolds number is a dimensionless value which is applied in fluid mechanics to represent whether the fluid flow in a duct or pat a body is steady or turbulent. This value is obtained by comparing the inertial force with the viscous force.
The Reynolds number id denoted by Re.
Reynolds number is given by,
Reynolds Number = Inertial Force / Viscous Force
The Reynolds number formula is expressed by,
uRLStringLine "R_{e}\, =\, \frac{\rho VL}{\mu }" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?R_{e}\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{\rho&amp;space;VL}{\mu&amp;space;}" width="89" height="41" 
Where,
ρ = density of the fluid,
V = velocity of the fluid,
μ = viscosity of fluid,
L = length or diameter of the fluid.
Reynolds number formula can be used in the problems to calculate the Velocity (V), density (ρ), Viscosity (μ) and diameter (L) of the liquid.
The Kind of flow is based on the value of Re
Example 1
Calculate the Reynolds number if a liquid of viscosity 0.5 Ns/m2 and relative density of 500 Kg/m3 through a 10 mm pipe flows with a Velocity of 3 m/s.
Solution
Given:
Viscosity of fluid, μ = 0.5 Ns/m2, 
Density of fluid, ρ = 500 Kg/m3, 
Diameter of the fluid, L = 10 × 10-3 m
The Reynolds formula is given by,
 Re = ρVL / μ
      = 500×3×10×10−3 / 0.5
       = 15000 x 10-3 / 0.5
       = 30
Here, we notice that the value of Reynolds number is less than 2000, therefore the flow of liquid is laminar.
Example 2
Determine the Reynolds number if a liquid flows through a diameter of 50 mm with velocity 5 m/s having density of 1500 Kg/m3 and viscosity of 0.9 Kg/ms.
Solution:
Given:
 Diameter of pipe L = 50 mm, 
Velocity of the fluid v = 5 m/s, 
 Density of fluid ρ = 1500 Kg/m3, 
Viscosity of fluid μ = 0.9 Kg/ms 
The Reynolds number is given by
 Re = ρVL / μ
       = 1500×5×0.050 / 0.9
<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;">      = 416.66
Hence, the flow is laminar.

The Resultant force is defined as the total force acting on a body along with their directions. When the object is at rest or travelling with the same velocity, the resultant force has to be zero. Since all the forces are acting towards the same direction, the resultant force should be same for all the forces.
If one force is acting perpendicular to another, the resultant force is determined by using Pythagorean theorem.The Resultant force formula is given by,
                                FR = F1 + F2 + F3
Where,
F1, F2, F3 are the forces acting in the same direction on a body.
If force F2 is perpendicular to force F1, the resultant force formula is given as,
Problem 1
If three forces 50N, 60N and 20N are acting on a body simultaneously and 20N is opposite to the direction of other two. Determine the resultant force.
Solution:
Given:
F1 = 50N,
F2 = 60N
F3 = 20N
(F3 is opposite to the other two, therefore F3 = -20N)
Resultant force formula is given by,
FR = F1+F2+F3
 = 50+60-20
= 90N

Example 2
If 4N and 9N forces act perpendicular to an object, determine the resultant force.
Solution:
Given:
F1 = 4N
F2 = 9N
Because they are perpendicular to each other, the resultant force formula is given by,
FR = √F12+F22
FR = √16+81
FR = √97
 = 9.84N

Grounded on Relativistic Doppler Effect, some of the solved samples are provided underneath:
Problem 1: A bus is moving towards john at 1.5 ×× 1088 m/s. The bus flashes a headlight of frequency 4200 Hz on john. At what frequency will John receive the light?
Answer:
Source velocity v<sub>s</sub> =  1.5 × 1088 m/s = 0.5 c, Observer velocity v = c, frequency νν = 4200 Hz
The frequency of light john receives is,
ν&#8217; = ν/(1 ± v<sub>s</sub>/v)
ν&#8217; = 4200/(1 &#8211; 0.5 c/ c)
ν&#8217; = 2100 Hz.
Thus, the frequency of light john receives is 2100 Hz.
Problem 2: A train leaves the station with a velocity of 40 m/s. What will be its frequency if the passenger standing still perceives the frequency at 440 Hz?
Answer:
Observed frequency ν&#8217; = 40 m/s,
Real frequency ν = ?
The speed of sound is v = 343 m/s.
The frequency of train is,
ν&#8217; = ν/(1 ± v<sub>s</sub>/v)
440 = ν/(1 ±± 40/343)
∴ frequency ν = 498.08 Hz
Thus, the frequency of train is 498.08 Hz.

Heat Release Rate formula
The Heat Release Rate is the crucial parameter to characterize a fire. There is a variety of methods to estimate Heat release rate. The most used techniques are based on mass balance. When the heat of combustion of fuel is known, the measure of mass loss can be evaluated. 
The heat produced by the burning sample is precisely accompanied by the reduction in the heat generated by the burner. The rate of heat release of the sample is measured by recording the decrease in the flow of gas. The constant temperature of the system removes the impact of inertia and permits a rapid change in the heat release rate.
The record of heat release rate is a measure of what would be released into the lit room. The heat release rate formula from the first law of thermodynamics is given by, 
&Delta;Qc = &Delta;W + &Delta;Qh + &Delta;U
Wherein,
Qc is the Chemical energy released in KJ/Kg,
W is the Work output in KJ/Kg,
Qh is the Heat transfer in KJ/Kg,

The refractive index of a medium is defined as how the light travels through that medium. It is a dimensionless measure. It defines how much a light ray can bent when it enters from one medium to the other. Snell&#8217;s law clarifies the relation between the angle of incidence and angle of refraction. So, there are two formulas for calculating the refractive index of a medium. Let us imagine that a ray of light is traveling from a medium a to another medium b. Then conferring from Snell&#8217;s law,

Spring is a tool used daily by many of us and their inertia are frequently neglected by assuming it as massless. It&#8217;s an extremely casual activity that a Spring, when strained, undergoes displacement when it is compacted it gets compressed and when its free it comes to its equilibrium position. This fact tells us that spring exerts an equal as well as an opposite force on a body which compresses or stretches it.

In fluid dynamics, the Mach number (M) named after Ernst Mach is a dimensionless quantity which describes the ratio of the flow of velocity past a boundary to the local speed or sound; wherein c is the speed of the sound in the medium.It shows how fast the object can move if it is moving equally or faster than the speed of the sound.
The Mach number formula is expressed by,

Mach number = Object Speed / Speed of Sound
This term is commonly applied in aeronautics when two objects move at high speed for e.g., wind channels and nozzles. The speeds of sound are termed on the basis the mach numbers.
If the Mach number &lt; 1, the speed is said to be subsonic.
When the Mach number ∼ 1, the speed is transonic.
If the Mach number &gt;1, the speed is supersonic
If the Mach number &gt;&gt;&gt;, the speed is hypersonic.   
Example 1
The speed of the aircraft is 800 ft/sec, determine the Mach number.
Solution:
Given:
 speed = 800 ft/sec, 
speed of sound = 980 ft/s.
Mach number formula is given by, 
Mach number = Speed of Object / Speed of sound
Mach number = 800 / 980
Therefore, Mach number = 0.816
Hence, the speed is subsonic.
Example 2
If the Mach number is 1.15, determine the speed of the object.
Solution:
Given:
Mach number M = 1.15,
speed of sound = 980 ft/s
Mach number formula is given by,
Mach number = Speed of Object / Speed of sound
Speed of object = Mach number × Speed of sound
                          = 1.15 × 980 ft/sec
Therefore, Speed of object = 1127
Hence, the speed is supersonic.

Heat Flux formula
Heat flux is the amount of heat transferred per unit area per unit time to or from a surface. Basically, it is a derived quantity since it involves the principle of two quantities viz. the amount of heat transfer per unit time and the area to or from which the heat transfer occurs.
The derived SI unit of heat rate is joule per second or watt. Heat flux density describes the heat rate per unit area. In SI unit of heat flux density is measured in W/m2. Heat flux is a vector quantity.<br Fourier&#8217;s law is an important application of these concepts. For a pure solid substance, the conductive heat flux JHc in one dimension is expressed by Fourier&#8217;s law.
JHc = &lambda; dT / dZ<br Where,<br JHc = conductive heat flux,<br T = temperature, <br &lambda; = thermal conductivity constant.

The speed of sound is defined as the distance travelled by a sound wave propagating through an elastic medium per unit time. The speed of sound in a particular medium depends on density and elasticity of a medium. More is the speed of sound greater is the elasticity and smaller is the density. The speed of sound is maximum in solids and minimum in solids.
The speed of sound formula is given by,
uRLStringLine "c\, =\, \sqrt{\gamma \times \frac{P}{\rho }}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\sqrt{\gamma&amp;space;\times&amp;space;\frac{P}{\rho&amp;space;}}" width="107" height="56" 
Where,

The strain energy per unit volume is known as strain energy density and the area under the stress-strain curve towards the point of deformation. When the applied force is released, the whole system returns to its original shape. It is usually denoted by U.
The strain energy formula is given as,

Example 2
A rod of area 90 mm^2 has a length of 3 m. Determine the strain energy if a stress of 300 MPa is applied when stretched. Young&#8217;s modulus is given as 200 GPa.
Solution:
Given:
Area A = 90 mm^2,
Length l = 3m,
Stress σ = 300 MPa,
Young’s modulus E = 200 GPa.
Volume V is given by the formula,
V = AL 
   = (90 × 10^−6) × 3
V = 27 x10^−6 m^3
The strain energy formula is given as,
U = σ^2 / 2E× V
  = (300×10^6)^2 / 2 x 200×10^9 x 27 x 10^-6
Therefore, U = 12.15 J.

Sound Pressure Level Formula
Sound pressure is the pressure applied by the sound waves. Sound pressure level is the is the ratio of the actual sound pressure and the reference level which is the lowest intensity sound that can be heard by maximum people. In other words, sound pressure level decides the amount of pressure on the sound.  It provides the logarithmic measures of rms value of the sound pressure to the reference value of the sound.
It is expressed in (dB).  
The sound pressure level formula is expressed by,
L<sub>p</sub> = 20 log10 (p<sub>rms</sub> / p<sub>ref</sub>)
Where, 
p = root mean square sound pressure in Pa,
p<sub>o</sub> = reference sound pressure in P<sub>a</sub>. (20 μP<sub>a</sub>)
Example 1: Calculate the rms pressure level if the sound pressure level is 40 dB?
Solution:
Given:
Sound pressure level = 40 dB, 
p<sub>ref</sub> = 20 μP<sub>a</sub>.
The sound pressure level formula is given as,
L<sub>p</sub> = 20 log10 (p<sub>rms</sub> / p<sub>ref</sub>)
The pressure level is given by,
e(L<sub>p</sub> / 20) = (p<sub>rms</sub> / p<sub>ref</sub>)
e(40 / 20) = p<sub>rms</sub> / (20×10−6)
4.85 × 108  = p<sub>rms </sub>/ (20×10−6)
Therefore, prms = 9.703 × 103 Pa.
Example 2: Determine the sound pressure level if the rms pressure value is given as 30 μP<sub>a</sub>.
Solution:
Given:
P<sub>rms</sub> = 30 μP<sub>a</sub>,
p<sub>ref</sub> = 20 μP<sub>a</sub>.
The sound pressure level formula is given by,
L<sub>p</sub> = 20 log10 (p<sub>rms</sub> / p<sub>ref</sub>)
= 20 log10 (30 / 20)
Therefore, L<sub>p</sub> = 3.52 dB

Potential energy is defined as the energy stored in an object. Potential energy can be divided into many types; Gravitational potential energy, Electric Potential Energy, <a href="https://byjus.com/elastic-potential-energy-calculator/" target="_blank">Elastic Potential energy</a> etc. Here the <a href="https://byjus.com/physics/gravitational-potential-energy-equation/" target="_blank">gravitational potential energy</a> is defined as the energy possessed by an object by virtue of its position relative to others. Elastic potential energy is defined as the energy possessed by virtue of stresses within its body and electric potential is defined as the energy possessed by an object by virtue of the total charge stored within. 
Formula for Potential Energy</b>
The formula for gravitational potential energy is given below. 
PE=mgh
Here, PE is the potential energy of the object that is to be calculated. It is measured in terms of Joules. ‘m’ is the mass of the object under consideration, measured in terms of kg, g is the acceleration due to gravity, given in terms of m/s2 and h is the height at which the object is placed with respect to the reference point, given in terms of metre. 
Real life example: </b>We all know that dams are constructed on rivers for the generation of electricity. But do you know the reason behind this. Here, the potential energy possessed by water is used to harness electrical energy. Water raised to a certain height gains potential energy with respect to the ground due to the gravitational force acting on it. This energy is used to turn the blades of turbines positioned in the dams that eventually helps in the generation of electricity. 
Derivation:</b>
As per the potential energy function for a conservative force, the force acting on an object can be given as,
\(F = \frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d} x}\)



Here the force acting on the object can be given as F=mg, and the distance from the point of reference can be given as h. 
Substituting these values, we get, 
\(U = -(mg(h_{1}-h_{2}))\)

\(U = (mg(h_{2}-h_{1}))\)

Here, h1 is the height of the point of reference and h2 is the height at which the object is positioned. 
Solved Examples</b>
Example 1:</b> A ball of mass 0.8 kg is dragged in the upward direction on an inclined plane. Calculate the total potential energy gained by this ball given that the height of the height of the wedge is 0.2 metre. 
Solution: </b>
It is given that mass of the object m = 0.8 kg. 
Since, the potential energy of the object is only dependent on its height from the reference position, we can say that, 
PE=mgh
Where, m = 0.2 kg, g = 10 m/s2 and h = 0.2 m. 
PE=0.8×10×0.2
PE=1.6 J
Example 2:</b> A wagon loaded with iron blocks is pushed up an inclined plane to its highest point. The total mass of the wagon is 50 kg and the height of the top most point from the ground is 5 metres. What is the total potential energy of the wagon at the top? 
Solution: </b>
Given that m = 50 kg, g = 10 m/s2 and h = 5 m. 
Substituting the above values in the formula, we get, 
PE=50×10×5
PE=250 J

The visible light is emitted and absorbed by tiny packets called photons and exhibit properties of both waves and particles. This property is known as wave-particle duality. 
Light waves can be measured in two different ways,
These waves are categorized according to the frequencies that have similar characteristics in the electromagnetic spectrum of the light. The subcategories of each spectrum vary according to the wave frequency. 
The color of these lights depends on the reflection quality from the objects on which the white light falls on. For example, the white wall appears because the wall reflects back all the colors.  
Any particular color that looks from any surface is the color that is reflected from the object when the light falls on it. 
The light wave and color formula is given by:
<strong style="line-height: 1.42857143;"> c = ν  x λ
where,
c = speed of light
v = frequency
λ= wavelength
Example 1
Calculate the frequency of the violet color whose wavelength is 400 nm.
Solution
Given: Wavelength = 400 nm
We know that, C (Speed of Light ) = ν (Frequency ) × λ ( Wavelength)
 ν = C / λ
 = 3×108  / 4.00×107
Therefore, frequency = 7.5 Hz
Example 2:
Determine the wavelength and predict the color of light which has a frequency of 6.00 × 1014 Hz, given the speed of light is 3 × 108 m / s.
Solution:
Given: Frequency = 6.00 x 1014 Hz
We know that, C (speed of light ) = ν (frequency ) × λ ( wavelength)
λ = C / ν
  = 3×108 / 6.00 × 1014
Therefore, λ (wavelength) = 0.5 × 10 -6
                 = 5000 × 10-9 m
                 = 5000 nm 
The color of the wavelength of 5000 nm is green.

In other words, transformer transforms the energy from one circuit to another. This occurs through electromagnetic induction. It is known as an efficient voltage converter, which can reduce the high voltage to low voltage and vice versa. A good-condition transformer consists of two windings, namely primary winding and secondary winding. There are two types of transformer; step up and step down transformers.
The transformer formula is given by,
uRLStringLine "\frac{V_{p}}{V_{s}}\, =\, \frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{V_{p}}{V_{s}}\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}}" width="74" height="39" 
Where
Vp = primary voltage,
Vs = secondary voltage,
Np = number of turns in the primary
Ns  = number of turns in the secondary. 
Example 1:
The number of primary and secondary windings is 60 and 100 respectively. The secondary voltage is given by 250V, determine the primary voltage.
Solution:
Given:
Np = 60, 
Ns = 100
Vs = 250V
The transformer formula is given by,
Vp / Vs = Np / Ns
Vp = Np / Ns ×Vs
    = 60 / 100 x 250
= 150 V
Example 2
The number of primary and secondary windings is 100 and 350 respectively. The primary voltage is given by 200V, determine the secondary voltage.
Solution:
Given:
Np = 100, 
Ns = 350 and 
Vp = 200V
The transformer formula is given by,
Vp / Vs = Np / Ns
Vs = Vp×Ns / Np
Vs = 200 × 350 / 100
= 700V

Moment refers to a very short period of time. If you consider a see-saw, putting weights on both the sides makes it to be in a balanced moment. If you put extra weight or less weight on one hand, the see-saw is no more balanced, and this is known as the unbalanced moment.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5662" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Moment.jpg" alt="Moment" width="574" height="250" 
The measure of turning effect is known as torque. The force which acts on the body of the torque is known as moment of force.
The moment formula is given by
Moment of force = F x d
F is the force applied, and
d is the distance from the fixed axis.
Moment of force is expressed in Nm.
Moment of force formula can be applied to calculate the moment of force for balanced as well as unbalanced forces.
Example 1
A 200 cm meter rule is pivoted at the middle point (at 50 cm point). If a weight of 10 N is hanged from the 30 cm mark and a weight of 20 N is hanged from its 60 cm mark, identify whether the meter rule will remain balanced over its pivot or not.
Solution:
According to the principle of moments, when an object is in rotational equilibrium, then 
Total anticlockwise moments = Total clockwise moments 
Total anticlockwise moments: 
Length of lever arm = (50 &#8211; 30) = 20 cm 
= 0.20 m
Since length of lever arm is the distance from its mid point, where its balanced force applied = 10 N 
Anticlockwise moment = Lever arm x Force applied
 = 0.20 x 10 = 2 Nm 
Clockwise moment: Length of lever arm = (60 &#8211; 50) 
= 10 cm 
= 0.10 m.
Since length of lever arm is the distance from the mid point, about which balanced Force applied = 20 N 
Clockwise moment = lever arm x force applied 
                               = 0.10 × 20 = 2 Nm 
Therefore,
 Since the total anti clockwise moment = total clockwise moment = 2 Nm, according to the principle of moments, it is in rotational equilibrium ie, the meter rule remains balanced about its pivot. 
Example 2
A 500 cm meter rule is pivoted at its middle point. If a weight of 2 N is hanged from the 20 cm point, Calculate the amount of weight required to be applied at the 80 cm mark to keep it in a balanced position.
Solution:
According to the principle of moments, To keep an object in rotational equilibrium, the sum of anticlockwise moments and clockwise moments acting should be be equal. Therefore, the amount of weight to be hanged from the 80 cm mark must be able to generate a clockwise moment equal to the anticlockwise moment generated by the weight hanged on the left side of the meter rule. 
Anticlockwise moment :
Length of lever arm = (50 &#8211; 20)
 = 30 cm 
= 0.30 m 
Since the length of lever arm is the distance from its mid point, where it is balanced 
Force applied = 2 N 
Anticlockwise moment = lever arm x force applied
 = 0.30 x 2 N 
 = 0.6 Nm 
Clockwise moment:
 length of lever arm = (80 &#8211; 50)
 = 30 cm 
= 0.30 m
Since the length of lever arm is the distance from its Force applied. 
Let it be &#8216;F&#8217;. 
Thus, clockwise moment = F x 0.30 
= 0.30 F Nm 
Clockwise moment = Anticlockwise moment 
0.30 F = 0.6 
F = 2 N 
A weight of 2 N needs to be hanged from  80 cm point to keep the meter rule balanced.

When two parallel plates are connected across a battery, the plates are charged and an electric field is established between them, and this setup is known as the parallel plate capacitor. The direction of the electric field is defined as the direction in which the positive test charge would flow.Capacitance is the limitation of the body to store the electric charge. Every capacitor has its capacitance. The typical parallel-plate capacitor consists of two metallic plates of area A, separated by the distance d.

The parallel plate capacitor formula is given by, 
uRLStringLine title="c=k\varepsilon _{0}\frac{A}{d}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?c=k\varepsilon&amp;space;_{0}\frac{A}{d}" alt="" 
Where,
ϵo = permittivity of space (8.54 × 10−12 F/m),
k = relative permittivity of dielectric material,
d = separation between the plates,
A = area of plates.
Example 1
A parallel plate capacitor is kept in the air has an area of 0.50m2 and separated from each other by distance 0.04m. Calculate the parallel plate capacitor.
Solution:
Given:
Area A = 0.50 m2,
Distance d = 0.04 m,
relative permittivity k = 1, 
ϵo = 8.54 × 10−12 F/m
The parallel plate capacitor formula is expressed by,
C = kϵoA / d
= 8.54×10−12 × 0.50 / 0.04 
= 4.27 x 10−12 / 0.04
Therefore, C = 106.75 x 10−12 F

Example 2: 
Determine the area of parallel plate capacitor in the air if the capacitance is 25 nF and separation between the plates is 0.04m.
Solution:
Given:
Capacitance = 25 nF,
Distance d = 0.04 m,
Relative permittivity k = 1, 
ϵo = 8.54 × 10−12 F/m
The parallel plate capacitor formula is expressed by,
C = kϵoA / d
A = dc / kϵo
= 0.04 × 25×10−9 / 1×8.54×10−12
A = 1 x10−9 / 8.54 ×10−12
Therefore, area of parallel plate capacitor is 117.09 m2.

Tangential acceleration concept is applied to measure how the tangential velocity of a point at a certain radius changes with time. Tangential acceleration is similar to linear acceleration but specific to the tangential direction which relates to circular motion.
In other words, the rate of change of tangential velocity of a particle in a circular orbit is known as Tangential acceleration. It directs towards tangent to the path of the body.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter wp-image-5866 size-full" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tangential-Acceleration-Formula-2.png" alt="Tangential Acceleration Formula" width="642" height="336" 
Tangential acceleration formula is expressed as
uRLStringLine "a_{t}=\frac{d\mid v\mid }{dt}" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a_{t}=\frac{d\mid&amp;space;v\mid&amp;space;}{dt}" width="85" height="39" 
Where 
at = tangential acceleration,
dv = change in angular velocity,
dt = change in time.
Tangential acceleration in terms of distance is given by,

Where,
v = linear velocity,
s = distance covered,
t = time taken
Tangential acceleration formula is applied to calculate the tangential acceleration and the parameters related to it.
It is expressed in meter per sec square (m/s2).
Example 1: A body accelerates uniformly on a circular path with a speed of 30 m/s to 70m/s in 20s. Calculate its tangential acceleration.
Solution:
Given:
Initial velocity vi = 30 m/s, 
          Final velocity vf = 70 m/s, 
       Change in velocity dv = vf &#8211; vi = 70 &#8211; 30 = 40 m/s 
       Time taken dt = tf &#8211; ti = 20 &#8211; 0 = 20s
The tangential acceleration is given by at = dv / dt
                                                           = 40 / 20
                                                            = 2 m/s2.
Example2:
A runner starts from rest and accelerates at a uniform rate 10m/s in the time interval of 5s, running on a circular track of radius 50m. Determine the tangential acceleration.
Solution:
Given:
 Initial velocity vi = 0, 
       Final velocity vf = 10 m/s, 
          Change in velocity dv = vf &#8211; vi = 10 &#8211; 0 = 10 m/s 
       Time taken dt = 5s 
The tangential acceleration is given by at = dv / dt
                                                           = 10 / 5
                                                           = 2m/s.

The law of universal gravitation states that any two objects in the universe attract each other with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
It’s a general Physics law derived from the observations by Isaac Newton. In modern language, the law states: every point mass attracts another single point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both the ends.

The electromagnetic wave is characterized by its wave phase, frequency, and direction of propagation of transverse field oscillation which consists of transverse electric and magnetic components. The plane that uses the transverse electric vector is associated with a quantity known as polarization plane.  Light is a transverse electromagnetic wave, but any natural light can be considered as unpolarized since the propagation of all the planes are equally probable. Therefore, based on the position of the polarizer we get horizontal or vertical polarized light.Polarized light is a condition where when each light waves are placed parallel to each other. It is possible to polarize only transverse waves and that light is built up by transverse waves.  
The degree of polarization completely depends on the matter and the angle at which the light is reflected. All the substances that could polarize light are known as polarizer and the phenomenon is known as polarization.
Polarization angle or Brewster&#8217;s angle formula is given by:
Where,
 n1 = initial medium
 n2 = other medium.
I = Io cos2θ

Example 1
Determine the value of polarizing light angles when the refractive index of green color glass is 1.515 and that of violet color is 1.521.
Solution:
Given:
 n1 = 1.55
 n2 = 1.52
The in1 = tan -1 (1.515 )
         = 56o 57’
The in2 = tan -1 (1.521 )
         = 56o 68’

Example 2
A plane polarized light beam is passed through an analyzer and the intensity is measured at 0.075 of the desired initial value. Identify the angle.
Solution:
Given:
I = 0.075
We know that,
I = Iocos2θ  or cos2θ = I / Io = 0.075
Therefore, θ = 74.1

A wave is defined as a kind of disturbance in a moving medium, for example, the waves of the ocean move in a medium and can see the movement of wave crest from one point to the other in a given time period. The motion of an object can be described regarding speed which describes the velocity of the object. 
A wave is visualized when a source vibrates and disturbs a particle in the medium. This can usually be seen in the case of tuning fork or ripples in water when a body is dropped, etc. 
The number of waves traveled in one second is the frequency and the time period is the reciprocal of the frequency of the waves. Wavelength is the distance between the corresponding points in any two consecutive waves. 
The Wave speed formula which involves wavelength and frequency are given by,
v = f λ

When the body is moving with a certain velocity and suddenly brakes are applied. You would have noticed that the body stops completely after covering a certain distance. This is called stopping distance.
The stopping distance is the distance traveled between the time when the body decides to stop a moving vehicle and the time when the vehicle stops completely. The stopping distance depends on factors including road surface, and reflexes of the car’s driver and it is denoted by d. 
Stopping Distance formula is given by,

Thermal expansion describes the tendency of an object to change in its area, volume and shape to a shift in temperature through a transfer of heat. Heat is a consistently decreasing function of the average molecular kinetic energy of an object. Heating up a substance increases its kinetic energy. 
Since thermal expansion leads to changes in dimension either in length or volume, therefore, there are three types of thermal expansion namely – Linear expansion, Area expansion, and Volume expansion.  
uRLStringLine "\frac{\Delta L}{L_{o}}\, =\, \alpha _{L}\Delta T" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\Delta&amp;space;L}{L_{o}}\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\alpha&amp;space;_{L}\Delta&amp;space;T" width="108" height="39"

Where, 
A = original area, 
ΔA = change in area, 
αA = area expansion coefficient, 
ΔT = temperature difference, 
A0 = expanded area.
Example 1
A 5m long rod is heated to 40oC. If the length of the rod expands to 7m after some time, calculate the expansion coefficient. Given room temperature is 30o C.  
Solution:
Given: 
Initial length Lo = 5 m, 
Expanded length L = 7 m
Change in length Δ L = 7 &#8211; 5 = 2 m
Temperature difference Δ T = 40o C &#8211; 30o  = 10o C
    = 283 K
The linear expansion formula is given by,
ΔL / Lo = αL Δ T 
∴  Length expansion coefficient is given by,
αL = ΔL / Lo×ΔT
    = 2 / 5 x 283
    αL = 14 × 10-4 K-1.

Tangential velocity is the linear speed of any object moving along a circular path. A point on the outside the edge of a turntable moves greater distance in one complete rotation than a point near to the center. When a body moves in a circular path at a distance r from the center, the body’s velocity is directed tangentially at any instant. This is known as tangential velocity. In other words, the linear velocity is its tangential velocity at any instant.

A coil of wire which is designed to generate a strong magnetic field within the coil is called a solenoid. Wrapping the same wire many times around a cylinder creates a strong magnetic field when an electric current is passed through it. N denotes the number of turns the solenoid has. More the number of loops, stronger is the magnetic field.
A solenoid is a type of electromagnet whose purpose is to produce a controlled magnetic field. If the purpose of a solenoid is to impede changes in the electric current, it can be more specifically classified as an inductor.  
The formula for magnetic field of a solenoid is given by,
B = μoIN / L
Where, 
N = number of turns in the solenoid,
I = current in the coil,
l = length of the coil.
Please note that magnetic field in the coil is proportional to the applied current and number of turns per unit length.
Example 1
Determine the magnetic field produced by the solenoid of length 80 cm under the number of turns of the coil is 360 and the current passing through is 15 A.
Solution:
Given:
Number of turns N = 360,

Permeability μo = 1.26 × 10−7 T/m,
Length l = 0.8 m.
The magnetic field in a solenoid formula is given by,

Newton’s law of cooling describes the rate at which an exposed body changes temperature through radiation which is approximately proportional to the difference between the object’s temperature and its surroundings, provided the difference is small, i.e.,

uRLStringLine style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="\frac{dT}{dt}\alpha (T_{t}- T_{s})" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{dT}{dt}\alpha&amp;space;(T_{t}-&amp;space;T_{s})" alt="" 

The Newton’s law of cooling is given by,
dT/dt = k(Tt – Ts)
Where
Tt = temperature at time t and
 Ts = temperature of the surrounding,
  k = constant.

The Newton’s Law of Cooling Formula is expressed by
T(t) = Ts + (T0 – Ts) e-Kt
Where,
t = time,
T(t) = temperature of the given body at time t,
Ts = surrounding temperature,
To = initial temperature of the body,
k = constant.

Please note that greater the difference in temperature between the system and surrounding, more rapidly the body temperature changes.
Example 1
The oil is heated to 70oC. It cools to 50oC after 6 minutes. Calculate the time taken by the oil to cool from 50oC to 40oC given the Surrounding temperature Ts = 25oC.
Solution:
Given:
Temperature of oil after 10 min = 50oC, 
Ts = 25oC, 
To = 70oC, 
t = 6 min
The Newton&#8217;s law of cooling formula is expressed as
 T(t) = Ts + (To &#8211; Ts) e-kt
T(t)−Ts / To−Ts = e-kt
-kt ln = ln T(t)−Ts / To−Ts
-kt = ln 50−25 / 70−25
     = ln 0.555
k = &#8211; (-0.555 / 6 )
= 0.092
If Tt = 45oC (average temperature as the temperature decreases from 50oC to 40oC)
Time taken is -kt ln e = ln T(t)−Ts / To−Ts
&#8211; (0.092) t = ln 45−25 / 70−25
&#8211; 0.092 t = -0.597
t = −0.597 / −0.092
= 6.489 min.
Example 2: Anil heats the water to 80oC. He waits for 10 min. How much would be the temperature if k = 0.056 per min and surrounding temperature is 25oC.
Solution:
Given:
Ts = 25oC,
To = 80oC, 
t = 10 min, 
k = 0.056 
The Newton&#8217;s law of cooling formula is expressed as
T(t) = Ts + (To &#8211; Ts)e-kt
      = 25 + (80 &#8211; 25)e-(0.56)
      = 25 + 55 × 0.57                                                                          
   = 45.6 oC 
Temperature cools down from 80oC to 45.6oC after 10 min.

If the usual position(i.e., when not stretched), there is no energy in the spring. But, when the position is altered from its usual position, the spring is able to store energy by the virtue of its position. This stored energy is known as potential energy. Potential<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> energy of the spring is the potential energy stored as a result of deformation of a particular elastic object, or a spring. It describes the work done to stretch the spring and depends on the spring constant k and the distance stretched.
The Potential energy of a spring is given by,
P.E = ½ k x^2
Where,
k = spring constant
x = spring displacement

Example 1: Determine the potential energy of a string whose spring constant is 200N/m and the displacement is 0.8m.
Solution:
Given parameters are,
k = 200N/m,
 x = 0.8m
Potential energy of a string formula is given by,
P.E = 1 / 2 k x2
P.E = ½ 200 x (0.8)2
    = 64 J

Example 2: The spring constant and displacement of a stretched string is 100N/m and 0.5m respectively. Determine the potential energy stored in the stretched string.
Solution:
Given parameters are,
k = 100N/m,
x = 0.5m
Potential energy of a string formula is given by,
P.E = 1 / 2 kx2
= 1 / 2 x 100 x (0.5)2

The amount of heat gained by a solid object to convert it into a liquid without any further increase in the temperature is known as latent heat of fusion. The content of latent heat is complex in the case of sea ice because it is possible for sea ice and brine to exist together at any temperature and melt at a temperature other than 0oc when bathed in a concentrated salt solution, just like it occurs in the walls of brine cells when brine cells migration occurs. If m kg of solid changes to liquid at constant temperature which is its melting point, the heat absorbed by the substance or the latent heat of fusion formula is given by,
      Q = m L
Wherein,
L = specific latent heat of fusion of substance.
If the temperature of the object varies from the lower temperature t1 to higher temperature t2, the heat gained or liberated by the material is given by,
        Q = mc Δt
         = mc (t2 &#8211; t1)
Therefore, the total heat gained or released by the substance will be,
Q = mL + mc Δt

Example 1
 A piece of metal at 20oC has a mass of 60g. When it is immersed in a current of steam at 100∘C, 0.5g of steam is condensed on it. Determine the specific heat of metal, given that the latent heat of steam = 540 cal/g.
Solution:
Let c be the specific heat of the metal.
Heat gained by the metal 
= m c Δt
= 60 × c × (100 &#8211; 20)
= 60 × c × 80 cal
Heat given by steam = mL = 0.5 × 540 cal
By the principle of mixtures,
Heat given is equal to Heat taken
0.5 × 540 = 60 × c ×80
c = 0.056 cal/g ∘C.

Example 2
Calculate the result if 64500 calories of heat are extracted from 100 g of steam at 100∘C. Latent heat of ice and steam are given as 80 cal/g and 540 cal/g respectively.
Solution:
If the full steam is converted into the water at 100∘C, then the temperature of water falls from 100∘C to 10∘C and then a part of water at 0∘C is turned into ice.
If the water converted into ice = mg
The heat gained to bring the steam at 100∘C to water at 100∘C = mL steam
= 100 × 540 cal 
= 54000 cal.
The heat gained to bring water at 100∘C into water at 0∘C
 = 100 × 1 × (100-0) 
= 10000
<span style="line-height: 1.42857;"> The total heat extracted,
= 54000 + 10000
 = 64000 cal.
Heat still remained 
= 64500 – 64000
 = 500 cal.
Amount of water converted to ice,
m = Q / L
 = 500 / 80
= 6.25g.

Molar concentration is the most convenient method of expressing the concentration of a solute in a solution. Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved per liter of solution, i.e., M = mol/L. All mole calculations are applied to determine the amount in moles of the solution, for which it is the molar concentration.
The balanced chemical equation leads to a mole ratio between the acid and the base, which in turn leads to amount of moles of the base. Finally the molar concentration of base is determined by the known volume and amount in moles.
The molar concentration formula is given by,

uRLStringLine title="Molar\; Concentration =\frac{Amount\; in\; moles}{Volume\; of\; Solution}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Molar\;&amp;space;Concentration&amp;space;=\frac{Amount\;&amp;space;in\;&amp;space;moles}{Volume\;&amp;space;of\;&amp;space;Solution}" alt="" 

Example 1
Determine the molar concentration of NaOH for the reaction between HCl and NaOH.
Solution:
The balanced chemical equation can be framed as, 
HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O
For an acid 
n(HCl) = 35.0 / 1000dm3 × 0.250 mol dm-3
           = 8.75 ×× 10-3mol

       the mole ratio NaOH : HCl = 1:1.
 The amount of NaOH present in moles is 8.75 × 10-3mol.
Now we have the equation,
uRLStringLine title="Molar\; Concentration =\frac{Amount\; in\; moles}{Volume\; of\; Solution}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Molar\;&amp;space;Concentration&amp;space;=\frac{Amount\;&amp;space;in\;&amp;space;moles}{Volume\;&amp;space;of\;&amp;space;Solution}" alt="" 

 First convert the volume of aqueous NaOH into dm-3
25 cm3 = 25 / 1000dm3
             = 25 × 10-3dm3
Therefore, molar concentration of NaOH
            = 8.75×10−3 / 25.0×10-3
Molar concentration of NaOH = 0.350 mol dm-3

Example 2
The concentration of Ca(HCO3)2 is 0.85 gmol/L. Convert this concentration into geq/L.
Solution:
Given :
[C] = 0.85 gmol/ L
[C]eq = [C][MM] / eq.mass
MM = 40.1(2) + 2{1+12+3(16)}
    = 202.2
Number of reference species = 2 
Therefore, eq.mass = Ca(HCO3)2 / 2
                   = 202.2 / 2

[C]eq = 0.85[202.2] / 202.2/2
 = 1.7 geq/L

The Mass concept decides the amount of matter is present in an object. It is a quantitative measure of an object’s resistance to acceleration. Not to get confused with the term weight, Weight is not a mass but the amount of gravitational force that acts on the given body.The molar mass, M is the physical property which is defined as the mass of a chemical substance divided by its amount of the substance. The SI unit of molar mass is kg/mol.  
The mass formula is given as
Where,
ρ = density and
v = the volume
The weight mass formula is given as
 m = w / g
Where,
w = weight,
m = mass, 
g = gravity
The mass formula is also given as
 m = F / a
If acceleration itself is the gravity, then
M = F / g
Where,
F = force
G = gravity
The well known Einstein&#8217;s mass-energy relation that provides mass energy formula as
 m = E / c2
Where,
E = energy,
m = mass, 
c = speed of light
The kinetic energy mass formula is given as
K.E = ½ mv2
Where,
m = mass,
v = velocity.

Example 1

Solution:
Given, 
weight of the body = 90 N,
The mass of the body is expressed by
m = w / g
= 90 / 9.8
    = 9.183 kg

Example 2
Determine the mass of a body if the K.E is 60 J and velocity is 7m/s.
Solution:
Given:
Kinetic energy, k.E = 60 J,
Velocity, v = 7 m/s
the mass is expressed by
m = 2 k.E / v2
   = 2 ×60 / 72
   = 2.44 kg

Moment of Inertia is a quantity which describes body’s tendency to resist angular acceleration. In other words it is the measure of the amount of moment provided to a body to conquer its own inertia. It describes about the object offering resistance to accelerate or slow down its own motion.
It is the sum of the products of the mass of every component in the body with the square of the distance from the point of rotation.  
Moment of inertia formula is given by
I = MR²
Where,
R is the Distance between the axis and rotation in m
M is the Mass of the object in Kg
I =  Moment of Inertia in Kgm²
It’s based on the shape and mass distribution of the body and also on the orientation of the rotational axis

Solution:
Given:
Moment of inertia, I = 20 Kgm², 
Radius of sphere, R = 1 m, 
Moment of Inertia formula is given by,
 I = MR²
 M = I / R²
        = 20 / 1

The net force is defined as is the sum of all the forces acting on an object. Net force can accelerate a mass. Some or the other force acts on any body either at rest or motion. The net force is a term used in a system when there is a significant number of forces.  
If N is the number of forces acting on a body, the net force formula is given by, 
FNet = F1 + F2 + F3….+ FN
Where,
 F1, F2, F3&#8230;.FN are the forces acting on a body.
Net force when a body is at rest:uRLStringLine class="aligncenter wp-image-5703 size-full" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Net-force-when-a-body-is-at-rest-1.jpg" alt="Net force when a body is at rest" width="458" height="345" 
When the body is at rest, the net force formula is given by,
FNet = Fa + Fg.
Where, 
Fa = applied force,
Fg = gravitational force.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter wp-image-5707 size-full" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Net-force-when-a-body-is-in-motion.jpg" alt="Net force when a body is in motion" width="458" height="345" 
When a force is applied on the body, not only the applied force is acting there are many other forces like gravitational force  Fg, frictional force Ff and the normal force that balances the other force. 
Therefore, the net force formula is given by,
FNet = Fa + Fg + Ff + FN.
Where, 
Fa = applied force, 
Fg = gravitational force, 
Ff = frictional force, 
FN =  normal force.
Example 1
In a tug of war, a fat man pulls with a force of 100 N on a side, and a lean man pulls with 90 N on the other side. Determine the net force.
Solution:
Given:
Force F1= 100 N,
Force F2 = -90 N.
The net force formula is given by,
FNet = F1 + F2
        = 100 &#8211; 90 
        = 10 N
Therefore, the net force is 10 N.
Example 2
A toy car is at rest, and a force of 70 N is applied to it. If the frictional force of 20 N, determine the net force.
Solution:
Given: 
Applied force Fa = 70 N, 
Frictional force Ff = -20 N.
The net force formula is given by,
FNet = Fa + Ff
        = 70 &#8211; 20
        = 70 N.
Therefore, the net force is 50 N.

In any fluid, the static pressure is exerted on the walls of the container and in the fluid. These forces act perpendicular to the walls of the container. When an external pressure is applied to the fluid, the pressure is distributed uniformly in all parts of the fluid and this is known as Pascal’s principle named after the Physicist Blaise Pascal.The Pascal’s principle refers to only the external pressure and within the fluid the pressure at the bottom is greater than the top.
According to Pascal’s principle, the force per unit area describes an external pressure which is transmitted through fluid and the formula is written as,

A photon is defined as the quantum of electromagnetic radiation. The term quantum refers to the smallest elemental unit of a quantity. Hence, one quantum of electromagnetic energy is known as a photon.
A photon is characterized either by wavelength (λ) or an equivalent energy E.
The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to the wavelength of a photon.
The Photon energy formula is given by,
uRLStringLine "E\, =\, \frac{hc}{\lambda }" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{hc}{\lambda&amp;space;}" width="64" height="38"

E = photon energy,
h = Planck&#8217;s constant (6.626×10−34 Js),

Photon energy formula is given by,
E = hc / λ
E = 6.626×10−34 ×3×108 / 650×10−9

The mass concept dialogue is a very standard one in physics. The well known special theory of relativity voices a lot more about relativistic mass, when there is comparative measurements of length and time in dissimilar frames. The relative change in mass is also perceived when the body is in motion. This concept is relativistic mass. Comparable to length contraction and time dilation a thing called mass increase happens when the object is in motion.
The relativistic mass formula is articulated as,
\(m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\)
Where,
the velocity of the moving body is v ,
Velocity of light is c 
Relativistic Mass Solved Examples
Some solved problems are given below based on Relativistic Mass:
Problem 1: An object in motion has mass of a 12 kg and travels in the air with velocity 0.82. What would be its rest mass?
Answer:
Known:
(Mass) m = 12 kg,
(Velocity) v = 0.82c,
c = 3 × 1088 m/s22.
The relativistic mass formula is articulated as,
\(m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\)
\(12=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.82)^{2}c^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\)
Rest mass, m<sub>o</sub> = 7.2 kg (approximately)
Thus, the rest mass of the given object is 7.2 kg.
Problem 2: A particle of mass 1.67 × 10^−24 kg travels with velocity 0.65. Compute its rest mass?
Answer:
Given: Mass m = 1.67 × 10^−24kg, v = 0.65c, c = 3 × 10^8 m/s^2.
The relativistic mass formula is articulated as,
\(m=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\)
\(1.67\times10^{-24}=\frac{m_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{(0.65)^{2}c^{2}}{c^{2}}}}\)
Rest mass, m<sub>o</sub> = 1.26 × 10^−24 kg (approximately).
Thus, the rest mass of the particle is 1.26 × 10^−24 kg.

According to Hooke’s law, the force required to compress or extend a spring is directly proportional to the distance it is stretched. It can be represented in an equation as F = kx, where F is the force applied, k is the spring constant and x is the extension of the object usually in meters.
In other words, spring constant is the force applied if the displacement in the spring is unity.
If a force F is considered that stretches the spring so that it displaces the equilibrium position by x.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter wp-image-5965 size-full" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/13114639/Spring-Constant.jpg" alt="Spring Constant" width="508" height="348"

According to electromagnetism, charge density is defined as a measure of electric charge per unit volume of the space in one, two or three dimensions. To be specific, the linear surface or volume charge density is the amount of electric charge per surface area or volume, respectively. 
Surface charge describes the electric potential difference between the inner and outer surface of different states like solid and liquid, liquid and gas or gas and liquid. The surface charge density is present only in conducting surfaces and describes the whole amount of charge q per unit area A.
Hence, the Surface charge density formula is given by,
σ = q / A.
Where, 
q = charge and 
A = surface area.
Electric field regarding surface charge density formula is given by,
σ = -2 ϵ0 E.
Where, 
ϵo = permittivity of free space,
E = electric field.
Example1

Solution:
Given:
Charge q = 5 C,
Area A = 10 m2
Surface charge density formula is given by,
 σ = q / A

Therefore, σ = 0.5 C/m2
Example 2
Calculate the surface charge density of sphere whose charge is 12 C and radius is 9 cm.
Solution:
Given:
Charge q = 12 C,
Radius r = 9 cm.
The surface charge density formula is given by,
σ = q / A
For a sphere, area A = 4 π r2
A = 4 π (0.09m)2
A = 0.1017 m2
Surface charge density, σ = q / A
σ = 12 / 0.1017
  = 117.994

Rotational kinetic energy is the energy absorbed by the object by the virtue of its rotation. The expressions for linear and rotational kinetic energy can be advanced in a parallel manner from the work-energy principle. Imagine the following parallel between a constant torque exerted on a flywheel with a moment of inertia I and a constant force exerted on a mass m, both beginning from rest.
For the linear case, beginning from rest, the acceleration from Newton&#8217;s second law is equivalent to the final velocity divided by the time and the average velocity is half the final velocity, presenting that the work done on the block gives it a kinetic energy equal to the work done. For the rotational case, also beginning from rest, the rotational work is τθ and the angular acceleration α provided to the flywheel is obtained from Newton&#8217;s second law for rotation. The angular acceleration is equivalent to the final angular velocity divided by the time and the average angular velocity is equal to half the final angular velocity. It follows that the rotational kinetic energy given to the flywheel is equivalent to the work done by the torque.

According to theory of relativity, time dilation is defined as the difference between elapsed time of the two events measured by either moving relative to each other located differently from gravitational mass or masses.
Let’s consider a clock kept in two different observers. One observer is at rest and other is moving along with the speed of light. The existence of time difference between the two clocks is known as time dilation.
The time dilation formula is given by,
uRLStringLine "T\, =\, \frac{T_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\, \frac{V^{2}}{C^{2}}}}" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{T_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\,&amp;space;\frac{V^{2}}{C^{2}}}}" width="118" height="56" 
Where 
<em>T</em> = time observed,
T0 = time observed at rest,
<em>v</em> = velocity of the object, and
<em>c</em> = velocity of light in vacuum.
Example 1
Determine the relativistic time, if T0 is 7years and v is 0.55c.
Solution:
Given:
T0 = 7 years
v = 0.55c 
Formula for time dilation is given by,
T = T0 /√ 1− v2/c2
  = 7 / 1−(0.55c)2 / c2
T = 7 / 1 − 0.552
7 / 0.6975
T = 10.035  = 11 years
Question 2: Calculate the time dilation if T0 is 15 years and v = 0.6c.
Solution:
Given:
T0 = 15 years and v = 0.6c
Formula for time dilation is given by,
T = T0 / √1−v2/c2
  = 15 / √1−(0.6c)2/c2
  = 15 / √1−0.62
  = 23.43 = 24 years

What is uniform circular motion?
uRLStringLine src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/uniform-circular-motion.jpg" alt="uniform circular motion" width="347" height="242" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5850" 
The term circular is applied to describe the motion in a curved path.The motion of any object along a circular path covering equal distance along the circumference in same interval of time is known as uniform circular motion. In any uniform circular motion, the speed remains constant, but the direction of the velocity changes. 
The tangential speed at every point on the circumference is found to be constant in uniform circular motion, and the tangential velocity vector is tangent at every point over the circumference. 
Tangential velocity is the vector formed to the tangential speed; therefore, the magnitude remains constant and equal to the tangential speed of the uniform circular motion. 
The Tangential speed of the uniform circular motion is given by,
V = 2π r / T 
Any object moving in uniform circular motion also has an angular velocity. 
The object’s velocity changes continuously and therefore there is an acceleration in the circular motion, and this acceleration is always directed towards the center of the circle which is termed as centripetal acceleration.  
Example 1
A racer is moving with a constant tangential speed of 50 m/s, takes one lap around a circular track in 40 seconds. Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration of the car.
Solution:
Given:
Speed v = 50 m/s
T = 40 seconds.
We know that,
A = v2 / r
T = 2 π r / v
Therefore, r = Tv / 2π
When both the formulas are combined, we get
a = v2 / (Tv/2 π) = v / (T/2 π)
   = 50 / 40 / 6.28
   = 7.86   
Example 2:
An object moving in a circular motion has a centripetal acceleration of 20 m/s2. If the radius of the motion is 0.5m, calculate the frequency of the motion.
Solution:
Given:
Acceleration = 20 m/s2
Radius = 0.5m
We know that,
a = v2 / r
20 = v2 / 0.5
V = 3.16 m/s
V = 2 πr / t
3.16 =3.14 / t
T = 1.006
F = 1/t = 1/1.006
Therefore, F = 0.99 Hz

The distance between consecutive crests of a wave, particularly the points of an electromagnetic wave is known as its wavelength.The wavelength and frequency are closely related. Higher the frequency, shorter is the wavelength. Since all the light waves move through a vacuum with same speed, the number of wave crests passing by a given point per second depends on the wavelength.
The Wavelength is denoted by λ. The Wavelength Formula of any wave is given by
Where, 
V= wave speed
f = frequency
The Wavelength is expressed in m, velocity is expressed in m/s, frequency is expressed in Hz.
Example 1
A harmonic wave is moving along a rope. The source generating the waves completes 50 to and fro motions in 20 s. A trough travels 3m in 4s; determine the wavelength of the wave.
Solution:
Time taken for 50 oscillations = 20 s 
Time for 1 oscillation, t = 20/50= 0.4 s
Frequency of 1 oscillation, f = 1/0.4 = 2.5 Hz
The wave travels a distance of 3m in 4s.
The wave speed is calculated by v = 3 / 4
                                  = 0.75 ms-1
The wavelength formula is given by λ = v / f
                                                       = 0.75/2.5
                                                       = 0.3 m.

Example 2
The frequency of a tuning fork is 200 Hz and sound travels a distance of 20 m while tuning fork executes 30 vibrations. Determine the wavelength of sound.
Solution
Given:
 Frequency f = 200 Hz, 
Distance d = 20 m, 
No of vibrations/ oscillations = 30
Wavelength λ = Distance / No of oscillations
                                  = 20 / 30
                                  = 0.66 ms-1

A wave is sensed when a source vibrates and disturbs a particle on the way in the medium. This can be seen in ripples in water when its surface is touched, in tuning fork, etc. This generates a wave pattern that starts to move along the medium from particle to particle. The frequency at which each particle vibrates is equal to frequency at which the source vibrates. In one period, the source is capable of displacing the first particle upward from the rest, back to rest, downward from rest and finally back to rest. This whole back and forth movement makes one complete wave cycle. Every wave has its own wavelength, frequency, speed and time period.
The wave formula which constitutes speed, wavelength and frequency are given by,
V = f λ
Where, 
v = velocity of the wave,
f = frequency of the wave,
λ = wavelength.
Example 1
A light wave travels with a wavelength of 700 nm. Determine its frequency.
Solution:
Given:
Wavelength λ = 700 nm,
Velocity of light v = 3 × 108m/s.
The frequency is calculated by,
f = v / λ
  = 3×108 / 700×10−9
f = 4.2 × 1014 Hz.
Therefore, the frequency of the light wave is 4.2 × 1014 Hz. 
Example 2: A sound wave has a wavelength of 2.5 mm. Determine its frequency.
Solution:
Given:

Tension is nothing but the drawing force acting on the body when it is hung from objects like chain, cable, string etc. It is represented by T (occasionally also symbolized as F<sub>t</sub>).
Tension formula is articulated as
uRLStringLine "T=W\pm ma" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?T=W\pm&amp;space;ma" width="104" height="12" 
Where,
mass of the body = m,
If the body is traveling upward, the tension will be T = W + ma
The weight of the object can be articulated as W = mg. Therefore, tension formula can also be represented as:

Thermal energy is the energy generated from heat. This heat is produced by the movement of small particles within an object. The faster the particles move, more the heat is generated.
Thermal energy is responsible for the temperature of the system and a part of total energy of the system which is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. 
The thermal energy is usually expressed by Q. It is directly proportional to the mass of the substance, temperature difference and the specific heat. 
The SI unit of thermal energy is Joules(J). 
The thermal energy formula is given by

Young’s modulus which can also be called as elastic modulus is a mechanical property of linear elastic solid substances. It describes the relationship between stress (force per unit area) and strain (proportional deformation in an object. The Young’s modulus is named after the British scientist Thomas Young. 
A solid object deforms when a particular load is applied to it. If the object is elastic, the body regains its original shape when the pressure is removed. Many materials are not linear and elastic beyond a small amount of deformation. The constant Young’s modulus applies only to linear elastic substances.  
The Young’s modulus formula is given by,
uRLStringLine "E\, =\, \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon }" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?E\,&amp;space;=\,&amp;space;\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon&amp;space;}" width="57" height="33" 
Where,
<em>E</em> = Young&#8217;s modulus
  <em>s</em> = stress
  <em>e </em>= strain

Strain, ε = 0.15
Young&#8217;s modulus formula is given by,
E = σ / ϵ
E = 4 / 0.15
