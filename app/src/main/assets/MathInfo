Associative property is a core concept in mathematics that shows a property of some binary operations. In propositional logic, associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs. According to associative property law it states that you can add or multiply regardless of how the numbers are grouped. Associative property in simple terms refers to grouping of numbers. It is mainly used to regroup things and any time type of computation depends on things being regrouped.

A pentagon is five-sided polygon in geometry. It may be simple or self – intersecting in shape. The five angles present in the pentagon are equal. A regular pentagon has all of the sides and angles are the same as each other. Pentagons can be regular or irregular and convex or concave. A regular pentagon is one with all equal sides and angles. Its interior angles are 108 degrees and its exterior angles are 72 degrees. An irregular pentagon is a shape that does not have equal sides and/or angles and therefore do not have specified angles. A convex pentagon is one whose vertices, or points where the sides meet, is pointing outwards as opposed to a concave pentagon whose vertices point inwards. Imagine a collapsed roof of a house.

A polygon having equal sides’ i.e. equilateral and equal angles i.e. equiangular is known as a regular polygon. An apothem is used to find the area of a regular polygon. Apothem is a segment that joins the polygon’s center to the midpoint of any side and it is perpendicular to that side. All vertices of a regular polygon lie on a common circle (the circumscribed circle), i.e., they are concyclic points. That is, a regular polygon is a cyclic polygon. Along with it, the property of equal-length sides, this implies that every regular polygon also has an inscribed circle or incircle that is tangent to every side at the midpoint. Thus, a regular polygon is a tangential polygon.

You know that polygons are 2D closed figures which are made up of 3 or more line segments. Triangle is the smallest polygon with 3 sides. Similarly, the polygon which has 8 sides is called an octagon. If the 8 sides of the octagon are equal in length and the angles between these sides are equal, the octagon is called a regular octagon. In a regular octagon, the measure of each of the interior angle is 135 degrees. The exterior angles measure 45 degrees each.
In this section, we will learn how to calculate the area of an octagon. We will also derive a formula for the same and solve some examples so as to give you a clear understanding of the concept.
Now, the formula for computing the area of a regular octagon can be given as:
uRLStringLine 6770" title="Octagon" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20120948/Octagon1.png" alt="Area of an Octagon Formula" width="179" height="186" /> Area of an Octagon = \(2a^{2}(1+\sqrt{2})\)
Where ‘a’ is the length of any one side of the octagon.
Properties of a Regular Octagon:
Before we go ahead and derive the area of an <a href="https://byjus.com/octagon-formula" target="_blank">octagon formula</a>, let us go through some of the basic properties of a regular octagon.
uRLStringLine class="aligncenter wp-image-6772 size-full" title="Angle of Octagon" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20121018/Angle-of-Octagon.png" alt="Area of an Octagon Formula" width="179" height="186" />Derivation:
For deriving the area formula, let us consider a regular octagon. Each of its side is of length <i>a </i>units. Mathematically, area of an octagon is defined as the region covered inside the boundary of an octagon.
Let us divide the octagon into 8 small isosceles triangles by joining each vertex to the center. Now if we compute the area of one of these triangles and multiply it by 8, we will obtain the area of the octagon.
Take any one of the triangles and draw a line from the center O of the hexagon to the midpoint of the base AB. Name the midpoint as D. You will get a right angled angle. The base length of the triangle is <i>a</i>, since it is nothing  but the side of the octagon. Thus, OD forms height of the triangle OAB.
uRLStringLine 6771" title="triangles of Octagon" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20121008/triangles-of-Octagon.png" alt="Area of an Octagon Formula" width="190" height="196" />uRLStringLine 6773" title="triangle" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20121100/triangle1.png" alt="Area of an Octagon Formula" width="214" height="196" />
Area of the octagon is calculated by summing up the areas of the 8 triangles, or, 8 x Area of one triangle (OAB).
We know the relation 2 sin²θ = 1- cos 2θ. We can write it as:
\(2 cos^{2} \theta =1+cos\;2\theta\)
\(tan^{2}\theta =\frac{1-cos\;2\theta}{1+cos\;2\theta}\)
\(tan^{2}(\frac{45}{2})=\frac{1-cos\; 45}{1+cos\; 45}\)
\(tan^{2}(\frac{45}{2})=\frac{1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}{1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}\)
\(tan^{2}(\frac{45}{2})=\frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{\sqrt{2}+1}=\frac{(\sqrt{2}-1)^{2}}{1}\)
\(tan(\frac{45}{2})=\sqrt{2}-1\)
Since ∠AOD = ∠BOD = 45/2, we can say\(tan(\frac{45}{2})=\frac{AD}{OD}\)
Hence,
\(\frac{AD}{OD}=\sqrt{2}-1\)
\(OD=\frac{a/2}{\sqrt{2}-1}=\frac{a}{2}(1+\sqrt{2})\)
Area of ∆ OAB = \(\frac{1}{2}\times AB\times OD\)
                      =\(\frac{a^{2}}{4}(1+\sqrt{2})\)
Area of the octagon = 8 x Area of ∆ OAB
=\(8\times \frac{a^{2}}{4}(1+\sqrt{2})=2a^{2}(1+\sqrt{2})\)
Area of an Octagon = \(2a^{2}(1+\sqrt{2})\)
Solved examples:

The Binary Numbering System is the most fundamental numbering system in mathematics as well as in all digital and computer based systems. Binary numbers follow the same set of rules as the decimal numbering system.
The Binary Numbering System contains only 0s and 1s. A binary number such as 101100101 is expressed with a string of 0s and 1s with each digit having a value twice that of the previous digit.  
While, writing the binary numbers you need to signify the number is binary (base 2), for instance: let’s take the value 101. As it is written, it would be hard to know to work out whether it is a binary or decimal value.  
The weight of each binary bit rely on its relative position within the number. The binary formula to convert decimal to binary is given below:
Binary to Decimal Formula
\[\large Decimal Number = n^{th} bit \times 2^{n-1}\]
To convert binary to decimal the following chart is used and binary is noted as per the given decimal number.

Converting binary to decimal number or decimal to binary number is an easy task. But, you need to be careful that not mix up the two sets of numbers. For instance, if you write the digits 10 on the page it could mean the number “ten” if we assume it to be a decimal number, or it could equally be a “1” and a “0” together in binary, which is equal to the number two in the weighted decimal format from above table.
So, for instance, if you use a binary number string it should add the subscript “2” to denote a base 2 number so the binary number would be written as 10&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Likewise, if it was a standard decimal number it would add the subscript “10” to denote a base 10 and written as 10&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

Recursion is the process of choosing a starting term and repeatedly applying the same process to each term to arrive at the following term. Recursion requires that you know the value of the term immediately before the term you are trying to find.
Speaking about the Arithmetic Sequence Recursive Formula, it has two parts: first a starting value that begins the sequence and a recursion equation that shows how terms of the sequence related to the preceding terms.
Here is the formula of Arithmetic Sequence Recursive: $t_{n}$ = $t_{n-1}$
Arithmetic Sequence Recursive formula may list the first two or more terms as starting values depending upon the nature of the sequence. However, the $a_{n}$<i> </i>portion of the is also dependent upon the previous two or more terms in the sequence.
Here are few examples:
Example 1: Write the first four terms of the sequence when:  $a_{1}$ = – 4 and $a_{n}$ = $a_{n-1}$ + 5
Solution:

Calculus is one of the branches of Mathematics that involves in the study of ‘Rage to Change’ and their application to solving equations. It has two major branches, Differential Calculus that is concerning rates of change and slopes of curves, and Integral Calculus concerning accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves.
Both branches make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus
The Differential Calculus splits up an area into small parts to calculate the rate of change. While, the Integral calculus joins small parts to calculates the area or volume. In short, it is the method of reasoning or calculation.

Chi Square is one of the most useful non-parametric statistics. Chi Square is used in data consist of people distributed across categories, and to know whether that distribution is different from what would expect by chance.
A Chi Square is one way to show a relationship between two categorical variables. There are two types of variables in statistics: numerical variables and non-numerical variables. The value can be calculated by using the given observed frequency and expected frequency. The Chi Square is denoted by X^2 and the formula is:
<!-- Ask a question with input field --> \[\LARGE X^{2}=\sum \frac{(O-E)^{2}}{E}\]
O = Observed frequency

3.64 (expected) 
3.36 (expected) 
 Solution:
Calculate this formula for each cell, one at a time. For example, cell #1 (Male/Full Stop):
Observed number is: 6
Therefore, $\frac{(6-6.24)^{2}}{6.24} = 0.0092$

Bayes’ Theorem formula is an important method for calculating conditional probabilities. It is used to calculate posterior probabilities. Bayes’s theorem describes the probability of an event, based on conditions that might be related to the event.
For instance, a patient is observed to have a certain symptom, and Bayes&#8217; formula can be used to compute the probability that a diagnosis is correct, given that observation. In simple words, suppose a doctor is interested in whether a person has cancer, and knows the person’s age. If cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes’ theorem, the person’s age can be used to access more accurate probability that the patient have cancer.
Bayes&#8217; theorem is named after Thomas Bayes, who first provided an equation that allows new evidence to update beliefs.

Correlation Coefficient is a measure of the association between two variables. It is used to find the relationship is between data and a measure to check how strong it is. The formulas return a value between -1 and 1 wherein one shows -1 shows negative correlation and +1 shows a positive correlation.
The correlation coefficient value is positive when it shows that there is a correlation between the two values and the negative value shows the amount of diversity among the two values.
There are several types of correlation coefficient formulas.
 But, one of the most commonly used formulas in statistics is <a href="https://byjus.com/pearson-correlation-formula">Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient Formula</a>.
Also known as bivariate correlation is the most widely used correlation method among all the sciences.
The correlation coefficient is denoted by <i>r</i>.
To find r, let us suppose the two variables as x &amp; y, then the correlation coefficinet r is calculated as:
\[\large r=\frac{n(\sum xy)-(\sum x)(\sum y)}{\sqrt{[n\sum x^{2}-(\sum x)^{2}][n\sum y^{2}-(\sum y)^{2}]}}\]
Here,
\[\large r_{xy}=\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{x}S_{y}}\]
$S_{x}$ and $S_{y}$ are the sample standard deviations, and $S_{xy}$ is the sample covariance.

\[\large \rho_{xy}= \frac{\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}\]
The population correlation coefficient uses $\sigma_{x}$ and $\sigma_{y}$ as the population standard deviations, and $\sigma_{xy}$ as the population covariance.

You might have noticed that before the commencement of a cricket match, a decision is to be made as to which team would bat or bowl first. How is this done? You see that the captains of the two teams participate in a coin toss wherein they pick one side of a coin each – say head or tail. The umpire tosses the coin in the air. The team which wins the toss gets to make the decision of batting or bowling first. This is one of the most common applications of the coin toss experiment. 
Why do you think this method is used? This is plainly because the possibility of obtaining a head in a coin toss is as likely as obtaining a tail, that is, 50%. So when you toss one coin, there are only two possibilities – a head (H) or a tail (L). However, what if you want to toss 2 coins simultaneously? Or say, 3, 4 or 5 coins? The outcomes of these coin tosses will differ. Let us learn more about coin toss <a href="https://byjus.com/probability-formulas" target="_blank">probability formula</a>.
Probability is the measurement of chances – likelihood that an event will occur. If the probability of an event is high, it is more likely that the event will happen. It is measured between 0 and 1, inclusive. So if an event is unlikely to occur, its probability is 0. And 1 indicates the certainty for the occurrence. 
Now if I ask you what is the probability of getting a head when you toss a coin? Assuming the coin to be fair, you straightaway answer 50% or ½. This is because you know that the outcome will either be head or tail, and both are equally likely. So we can conclude here:
Number of possible outcomes = 2
Number of outcomes to get head = 1
Probability of getting a head = ½
Hence,
\(Probability\;of\;getting\;a\;head = \frac{No\;of\;outcomes\;to get\;head}{No\;of\;possible\;outcomes}\)
We can generalise the coin toss probability formula:
\(Probability\;of\;certain\;event=\frac{Number\;of\;favourable\;outcomes}{Total\;number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}\)
Question: Two fair coins are tossed simultaneously. What is the probability of getting only one head?
Solution:
When 2 coins are tossed, the possible outcomes can be {HH, TT, HT, TH}.
Thus, total number of possible outcomes = 4
So number of desired outcomes = 2
Therefore, probability of getting only one head 
\(=\frac{Number\;of\;favourable\;outcomes}{Total\;number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}\)
Solution:
When 3 coins are tossed, the possible outcomes can be {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}.
Thus, total number of possible outcomes = 8
So number of desired outcomes = 4
Therefore, probability of getting at least 2 tails =
\(\frac{No\;of\;favourable\;outcomes}{Total\;number\;of\;possible\;outcomes}\)
\(=\frac{4}{8}=\frac{1}{2}\)

The Covariance Matrix is also known as dispersion matrix and variance-covariance matrix. The covariance between two jointly distributed real-valued random variables X and Y with finite second moments is defined as.
$\LARGE Cov(X,Y)=\sum \frac{(X_{i}-\overline{X})(Y_{i}-\overline{Y})}{N}=\sum \frac{X_{i}Y_{i}}{N}$
Question: Calculation of Covariance Matrix from Data Matrix:
Suppose the data matrix $y_{1}=5_{z1-z2}$ and $y_{1}$ = $2_{z2}$ with rows corresponding to subjects and columns are variables. Calculate a mean for each variable and replace the data matrix. 

Now the matrix of deviations from the mean is: $Y-\overline{Y}$
Therefore the covariance matrix of the observation is
$Z=\begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp; -4 \\ -1 &amp; 2 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; -2\\ 2 &amp; 4 \end{pmatrix}$
The diagonal elements of this matrix are the variances of the variables, and the off-diagonal elements are the covariances between the variables. 
$\frac{1}{N-1}Z^{1}Z=\frac{1}{4}\begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp;-1 &amp;0 &amp;1 &amp; 2\\ -4 &amp;2 &amp;0 &amp;-2 &amp;4 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp;-4 \\ -1 &amp;2 \\ 0 &amp;0 \\ 1 &amp;-2 \\ 2 &amp;4 \end{pmatrix}$

All cubic equations have either one real root, or three real roots. If the polynomials have the degree three, they are known as cubic polynomials.
The  cubic  equation is of the form,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Depressing the Cubic Equation
Substitute $\large x= y-\frac{b}{3a}$ in the above cubic equation, then we get,
$\large a\left ( y-\frac{b}{3a} \right )^{3}+b\left ( y-\frac{b}{3a} \right )^{2}+c\left ( y-\frac{b}{3a} \right )+d=0$
Simplifying further, we obtain the following depressed cubic equation &#8211;
$\large ay^{3}+\left ( c-\frac{b^{2}}{3a} \right )y+\left ( d+\frac{2b^{3}}{27a^{2}} +\frac{bc}{3a}\right )=0$
It must have the term in $x^{3}$ or it would not be cubic ( and so a≠0), but any or all of b, c and d can be zero. For instance: 
For instance: $x^{3}-6\times 2+11x-6=0\;or\;4x^{3}+57=0\;or\;x^{3}+9x=0$
This equation can be factorised to give
(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)=0

In statistic, the Coefficient of variation formula or known as CV, also known as relative standard deviation (RSD) is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. When the value of coefficient of variation is lower, it means the data has less variability and high stability.
The formula for coefficient of variation is given below:
\[\LARGE Coefficient\;of\;Variation\;Formula = \frac{Standard\;Deviation}{Mean}\]
As per sample and population data type, the formula for standard deviation may vary &#8211;
\[\large Sample\;Standard\;Deviation=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}-\overline{X})^{2}}}{n-1}\]
\[\large Population\;Standard\;Deviation=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}-\overline{X})^{2}}}{n}\]
Trying to compare the two test results is challenging. Comparing standard deviations doesn’t really work, because the means are also different. Calculation using the formula CV=(SD/Mean)*100 helps to make sense of the data:

Looking at the standard deviations of 10.2 and 12.7, you might think that the tests have similar results. However, when you adjust for the difference in the means, the results have more significance:
Regular test: CV = 17.03
Randomized answers: CV = 28.35

Direct Variation is said to be the relationship between two variables in which one is a constant multiple of the other. For example, when one variable changes the other changes in proportion to the first. If b is directly proportional to a, the equation is of the form b = ka (where k is a constant).Two variables are said to be in direct variation when the variables are related in such a way that the ratio of their values always remains the same.

A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction. In Geometrically, we can picture a vector as a directed line segment, whose length is the magnitude of the vector and with an arrow indicating the direction.
Vector is typically represented by an arrow whose direction is the same as that of the quantity and whose length is proportional to the quantity magnitude. Vector quantities are often represented by scaled vector diagrams. The vector diagram depicts a displacement vector.

(b) The vector from (1, -3, -5) to (2, -7, 0)

(b): Same thing here: {2 -1, 7 &#8211; (-3), 0 (-5)} = {1, -4, 5}
Notice that the only difference between the first two is the signs are all opposite.  This difference is important as it is this difference that tells us that the two vectors point in opposite directions.

To compare the two given observations we use effect size formula. To make some important decision and access other results from the comparison of the two sets of the data we use this method. Effect size formula is also used to predict and forecast possibilities by comparing them. We first calculate the mean and then subtract them. Standard deviation is also calculated for both the observations and then we find the squares.

Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. It emerges independently in number of early cultures as a practical way of dealing with lengths, area and volumes.
Geometry can be divided into two different types: Plane Geometry and Solid Geometry. The Plane Geometry deals with shapes such as circles, triangles, rectangles, square and more. Whereas, the Solid Geometry is concerned in calculating the length, perimeter, area and volume of various geometric figures and shapes. And are also used to calculate the arc length and radius etc.
The main concern of every student about this subject is the Geometry Formula. They are used to calculate the length, perimeter, area and volume of various geometric shapes and figures.  There are many geometric formulas, which are related to height, width, length, radius, perimeter, area, surface area or volume and much more.
Some geometric formula are rather complicated and few you might hardly ever seen them, however, there are some basic formulas which are used in our daily life to calculate the length, space and so on.
Here is a list of several most important geometry formulas that you use for solving various problems.

In simple sense, hyperbola looks similar to to mirrored parabolas. The two halves are called the branches. When the plane intersect on the halves  of a right circular cone angle of which will be parallel to the axis of the cone, a parabola is formed.
A hyperbola contains: two foci and two vertices. The foci of the hyperbola are away from the hyperbola’s center and vertices. Here is an illustration to make you understand:
uRLStringLine class="size-full wp-image-6529 aligncenter" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/23125551/Hyperbola-Formula.png" alt="Hyperbola Formula" width="531" height="359" />
The equation for hyperbola is,
\[\large \frac{(x-x_{0})^{2}}{a^{2}}-\frac{(y-y_{0})^{2}}{b^{2}}=1\]
Where,
Let us learn the basic terminologies related to hyperbola formula:
The line that passes through the center, focus of the hyperbola and vertices is the Major Axis. Length of the major axis = 2a. The equation is given as:
\[\large y=y_{0}\]
The line perpendicular to the major axis and passes by the middle of the hyperbola is the Minor Axis.
\[\large x=x_{0}\]
The variation in the conic section being completely circular is eccentricity. It is usually greater than 1 for hyperbola. Eccentricity is $2\sqrt{2}$ for a regular hyperbola. The formula for eccentricity is:
\[\large \frac{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}{a}\]
Two bisecting lines that is passing by the center of the hyperbola that doesn’t touch the curve is known as the Asymptotes. The equation is given as:
\[\large y=y_{0}+\frac{b}{a}x-\frac{b}{a}x_{0}\]
\[\large y=y_{0}-\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{b}{a}x_{0}\]
Directrix of a hyperbola is a straight line that is used in generating a curve. It can also be defined as the line from which the hyperbola curves away from. This line is perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. The equation of directrix is:
\[\large x=\frac{\pm a^{2}}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}\]
The point of the branch that is stretched and is closest to the center is the vertex. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">The vertex points are 
On a hyperbola, focus (foci being plural) are the fixed points such that the difference between the distances are always found to be constant. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">The two focal points are: 
\[\large\left(x_{0}+\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}},y_{0}\right)\]
\[\large \left(x_{0}-\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}},y_{0}\right)\]3

Find the following: Vertex, Asymptote, Major Axis, Minor Axis and Directrix?
Solution:
Given,
The vertex point: $(a, y_{0})$ and $(-a, y_{0})$ are: $(9, 2)$ and $(-9, 2)$

The orthocenter is the intersecting point for all the altitudes of the triangle. The point where the altitudes of a triangle meet is known as the Orthocenter. In the below mentioned diagram orthocenter is denoted by the letter ‘O’. There is no direct formula to calculate the orthocenter of the triangle.

The method starts with a function f defined over the real numbers x, the function&#8217;s derivative f&#8217;, and an initial guess $x_{0}$ for a root of the function f. If the function satisfies the assumptions made in the derivation of the formula and the initial guess is close, then a better approximation $x_{1}$.
In general solving an equation f(x) = 0 is not easy, though we can do it in simple cases like find roots of quadratics. If the function is complicated we can approximate the solution using an iterative procedure also known as a numerical method. One simple method is called Newton’s Method.

In probability and statistics, the t-distribution is any member of a family of continuous probability distributions that arises when estimating the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown.
According to the central limit theorem, the sampling distribution of a statistic will follow a normal distribution, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large.
Therefore, when we know the standard deviation of the population, we can compute a z-score, and use the normal distribution to evaluate probabilities with the sample mean.
The t-distribution with degrees of freedom &#8220;<em>n – 1</em>&#8221; is given below.
\[\large \boldsymbol{t=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}}}\]
Example: The CEO of light bulbs manufacturing company claims that an average light bulb lasts 300 days. A researcher randomly selects 15 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 290 days, with a standard deviation of 50 days. If the CEO&#8217;s claim were true, what is the probability that 15 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 290 days?
Solution:
The traditional approach requires you to compute the t statistic, based on data presented in the problem description.
The first thing we need to do is compute the t statistic, based on the following equation:
Where $\overline{x}$ is the sample mean, $\mu$ is the population mean, <em>s</em> is the standard deviation of the sample, and <em>n</em> is the sample size.
Using the formula: $t=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}}$
$t=\frac{290-300}{\frac{50}{\sqrt{15}}}$
$=\frac{-10}{12.909945}=0.7745966$
Since we will work with the raw data, we select &#8220;Sample mean&#8221; from the Random Variable dropdown box.
The cumulative probability: 0.226. Hence, if the true bulb life were 300 days, there is a 22.6% chance that the average bulb life for 15 randomly selected bulbs would be less than or equal to 290 days

                          Reactants often yield quantities of products that are less than those calculated on the basis of the formulated chemical reaction. The percent yield formula is used to determine the percentage of the theoretical yield that was formed in a reaction.
The ideal amount of product is called the theoretical yield and it is obtained by working a stoichiometry problem. Measuring the amount of product formed gives us the actual yield. From the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield we can calculate the percentage yield.

Ratio analysis is an important tool that is used in inter-business and intra-business comparison. 
For a quick indication of a business’s financial health in key areas, ratio analysis comes handy. Ratio analysis is broadly classified into four types:
1. Liquidity Ratios
To help identify the short term liquidity of a firm, this ratio is used. It has mainly two types of ratio under this. Current ratio which let us know the short term solvency of a firm.
\[\large Current\;Ratio=\frac{Current\;Asset}{Current\;Liabilities}\]
\[\large Quick\;Ratio=\frac{(Total\;Current\;Ratio-Inventory)}{Total\;Current\;Liabilities}\]
Quick ratio helps us find the solvency for six months and the reason why inventory is subtracted is that inventory usually take more than six month to convert into liquid asset.  
Profit is the main objective of business. All business needs to be operating on profit. These ratios are used to know the profitability of a business and the measure the success effectively over a period of time.
These ratios are used by the business owners, creditors, government officials to know how the business is faring. If a business is asking for loan from a bank, then the bank with by default check the profitability status using these ratios.
The main ratios covered within this category are:
\[\large Net\;Profit\;Ratio=\frac{-Net\;profit\;after\;tax}{Net\;Sales}\times 100\]
\[\large Gross\;Profit\;Ratio=\frac{Gross\;Profit}{Net\;Sales}\times 100\]
\[\large Operating\;Ratio=\frac{Operating\;Cost}{Net\;Sales}\times 100\]
\[\large Earnings\;per\;share=\frac{Net\;Income-Preferred\;Dividend}{Weighted\;Average\;number\;of\;shares\;outstanding}\times 100\]
This ratio is also known as turnover ratio, this ratio measures the efficiency of a firm and converting its products into cash. The ratio is measured in days.
The ratios under this category are:
\[\large Inventory\;Turnover\;Ratio=\frac{Cost\;of\;goods\;sold}{Average\;Inventory}\]
\[\large Receivables\;Turnover\;Ratio=\frac{Net\;Credit\;Sales}{Average\;Trade\;Receivable}\]
To see if the business can survive for the long term period, solvency ratios are used. This ratio helps evaluate the ability to pay the long term debt of a business. 
Mathematically it is written as:
\[\large Debt\;Equity\;Ratio=\frac{Total\;Liabilities}{Stakeholder&#8217;s\;Equity}\]
The ratio is given as:
\[\large Proprietary\;Ratio=\frac{Stakeholder&#8217;s\;Equity}{Total\;Assets}\times 100\]

Statistics is a branch of mathematics which deals with numbers and data analysis. Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Statistical theory defines a statistic as a function of a sample where the function itself is independent of the sample&#8217;s distribution.
In short, Statistics is associated with collecting, classifying, arranging and presenting numerical data. It allows us to interpret various results from it and forecast many possibilities. Statistics deals with facts, observations and information which are in the form of numeric data only. With the help of statistics, we are able to find various measures of central tendencies and the deviation of different values from the center.

In geometry, you come across different types of figures which properties that set them apart from one another. One common figure among them is a triangle. A triangle is a closed figure, a <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/polygon/" target="_blank">polygon</a>, with three sides. It has 3 vertices and its 3 sides enclose 3 interior angles of the triangle. The sum of the three interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.  
The most common types of triangle that we study about are equilateral, isosceles, scalene and right angled triangle. In this section, we will talk about the right angled triangle, also called right triangle, and the formulas associated with it.
A right triangle is the one in which the measure of any one of the interior angles is 90 degrees. It is to be noted here that since the sum of interior angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, only 1 of the 3 angles can be a right angle. If the other two angles are equal, that is 45 degrees each, the triangle is called an isosceles right angled triangle. However, if the other two angles are unequal, it is a scalene right angled triangle.
The most common application of right angled triangles can be found in trigonometry. In fact, the relation between its angles and sides forms the basis for trigonometry.
Where b and h refers to the base and height of triangle respectively.
Where a, b and c are the measure of its three sides.

The side opposite to the right angle, that is the longest side, is called the hypotenuse of the triangle. In ∆ABC, AC is the hypotenuse. Angles A and C are the acute angles. We name the other two sides (apart from the hypotenuse) as the ‘base’ or ‘perpendicular’ depending on which of the two angles we take as the basis for working with the triangle.
Derivation:
Consider a right angled triangle ABC which has B as 90 degrees and AC is the hypotenuse.
uRLStringLine 6783" title="triangle ABC" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20124025/triangle-ABC.png" alt="Right Triangle Formula" width="189" height="186" />Now we flip the triangle over its hypotenuse such that a rectangle ABCD with width h and length b is formed.
uRLStringLine 6784" title="rectangle ABCD" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20124054/rectangle-ABCD.png" alt="Right Triangle Formula" width="343" height="221" />You already know that area of a rectangle is given as the product of its length and width, that is, length x breadth.
Hence, area of the rectangle ABCD = b x h
As you can see, the area of the right angled triangle ABC is nothing but one-half of the area of the rectangle ABCD.
Thus, \(Area of \Delta ABC = \frac{1}{2} Area of rectangle ABCD\)
Hence, area of a right angled triangle, given its base b and height 
\(h= \frac{1}{2} bh\)
Solved Examples:
Question 1: The length of two sides of a right angled triangle is 5 cm and 8 cm. Find:
Solution: Given,
One side a = 5cm
Other side b = 8 cm
Using Pythagoras theorem, 
\(Hypotenuse^{2} = Perpendicular^{2} + Base^{2}\)

\(c^{2} = a^{2} +b^{2}\)

\(c^{2} = 5^{2} +8^{2}\)

\(c= \sqrt{25+64}= \sqrt{89}= 9.43cm\)

Here, area of the right triangle =
 \(\frac{1}{2} (8*5)= 20cm^{2}\) 
Question 2:  The perimeter of a right angled triangle is 32 cm. Its height and hypotenuse measure 10 cm and 13cm respectively. Find its area.
Solution: Given,
Perimeter = 32 cm 
Hypotenuse a= 13 cm
Height b= 10 cm
Third side, c=?
We know that perimeter = a+ b+ c
32 cm = 13 + 10 + c
Therefore, c = 32 &#8211; 23 = 9 cm
\(Area = \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} (9*10)= 45cm^{2}\)

When large number of data are concerned, then summation is needed quite often. To write a very large number, summation notation is useful.  The sequence [1,2,4,2..] whose value is the sum of the each number in the sequence is summation. In simple words, summation notation helps write a short form for addition of very large number of data. We use this symbol &#8211; 
 We use this symbol &#8211;   , called sigma to denote summation. When a sequence is needed to add from left to right, it could run intermediate result in a partial sum, running total or prefix sum. 
The form in which the summation notation is used:

A series has a constant difference between terms. For example, 3 + 7 + 11 + 15 + ….. + 99. We name the first term as <em>a1</em>. The common difference is often named as “<em>d</em>”, and the number of terms in the series is <i>n.  </i>
We can find out the sum of the arithmetic series by multiplying the number of times the average of the last and first terms.

Mathematically, square is obtained when the number is multiplied by itself. But square root, is much more complicated to find the original number required. Which is why this formula is used. The required square number is usually a lengthy process and result in a long decimal form. We know that the square root 81 is 9, but what if we have to find the square root of 5? Using the calculator, we can see that the square root of 5 , which is denoted by: $\sqrt{5}$ equals 2.236. Square root sometimes need to found out in geometry to find the side of a particular shape. Let&#8217;s say, in pythagoras theorem, the result of finding the side using the theorem need not be in perfect square.

When a polynomial has a numerator higher than the denominator, then a slant asymptote occurs. Slant asymptote can also be referred to an oblique. To find the oblique, we need to divide the numerator to the denominator using synthetic division method or long division.

The Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function&#8217;s derivatives at a single point. The concept of a Taylor series was formulated by the Scottish mathematician James Gregory and formally introduced by the English mathematician Brook Taylor in 1715.
A function can be approximated by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series. Taylor&#8217;s theorem gives quantitative estimates on the error introduced by the use of such an approximation. The polynomial formed by taking some initial terms of the Taylor series is called a Taylor polynomial.
The Taylor series of a function is the limit of that function&#8217;s Taylor polynomials as the degree increases, provided that the limit exists. A function may not be equal to its Taylor series, even if its Taylor series converges at every point. A function that is equal to its Taylor series in an open interval (or a disc in the complex plane) is known as an analytic function in that interval.
The Taylor series of a real or complex-valued function <em>f(x)</em> that is infinitely differentiable at a real or complex number a is the power series.
or you can make this formula simple and more compact by using the sigma notation.
Example: Find the Taylor series with center $x_{0}=0 for the hyperbolic cosine function <em>f(x)</em> = <em>cosh x</em> by using the fact that <em>cosh x</em> is the derivative of the hyperbolic sine function <em>sinh x</em>, which has as its Taylor series expansion.
$\large sinh&#58; x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{\left(2n+1\right)!}$
Solution: 
(Note: If you remember the Taylor expansions for <em>sin x</em> and <em>cos x</em>, you get an indication, why their hyperbolic counterparts might deserve the names “<em>sine</em>” and “<em>cosine</em>”).
Since,
$\large sinh&#58; x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2n+1}}{\left(2n+1\right)!}=x+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{5}}{5!}+&#8230;$
Its derivative <em>cosh x</em> has the Taylor expansion.
$\large cosh &#58; x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\left ( 2n+1 \right )x^{2n}}{\left ( 2n+1 \right )!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{2n}}{\left ( 2n \right )!}$
The last step follows from the fact that.
$\large \frac{2n+1}{\left ( 2n+1 \right )!}=\frac{2n+1}{1\cdot2\cdot\cdot\cdot\left (2n\right)\cdot\left (2n+1\right)}=\frac{1}{\left (2n\right)!}$
The hyperbolic functions differ from their trigonometric counterparts in that they do not sport alternating signs.

All trigonometric formulas are divided into two major systems: The <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/trigonometric-identities/">Trigonometric Identities</a> and Trigonometric Ratios.
Trigonometric Identities are some formulas that involve the trigonometric functions. These trigonometry identities are true for all values of the variables.
Trigonometric Ratio is known for the relationship between the measurement of the angles and the length of the side of the right triangle.
We also provide the basic trigonometric table pdf that gives the relation of all trigonometric functions along with their standard value. These trigonometric formulae are helpful in determining the domain, range, and value of a compound trigonometric function.
Students can refer to the formulas provided below or can also download the trigonometric formulas pdf that is provided above.
In a right-angled <a href="https://byjus.com/maths/triangles/">triangle</a>, we have 3 sides namely – Hypotenuse, Opposite side (Perpendicular) and Adjacent side(Height). The longest side is known as the hypotenuse, the side opposite to the angle is opposite and the side where both hypotenuse and opposite rests is the adjacent side.
There are basically 6 Laws used for finding the elements in Trigonometry. They are called trigonometric functions.
The six trigonometric functions are sine, cosine, secant, co-secant, tangent and co-tangent. By using the above right angled triangle as reference, the trigonometric functions or trigonometric identities are derived:
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(\sin \theta = \frac{Opposite}{Hypotenuse}\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(\sec \theta = \frac{Hypotenuse}{Adjacent}\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(\cos\theta = \frac{Adjacent}{Hypotenuse}\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(\tan \theta =\frac{Opposite}{Adjacent}\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(cosec \theta = \frac{Hypotenuse}{Opposite}\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(cot \theta = \frac{Adjacent}{Opposite}\)
The Reciprocal Identities are given as:
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(cosec\theta =\frac{1}{\sin\theta }\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(sec\theta =\frac{1}{\cos\theta }\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(cot\theta =\frac{1}{\tan\theta }\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(sin\theta =\frac{1}{cosec\theta }\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(cos\theta =\frac{1}{\sec\theta }\)
<span class="latex-for-amp">\(tan\theta =\frac{1}{cot\theta }\)
All these are taken from a right angled triangle. With the length and base side of the right triangle given, we can find out the sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant and cotangent values using trigonometric formulas. The reciprocal trigonometric identities are also derived by using the trigonometric functions.
All trigonometric identities are cyclic in nature. They repeat themselves after this periodicity constant. This periodicity constant is different for different trigonometric identity.
tan 45 = tan 225  but this is true for cos 45 and cos 225.
Refer to the above trigonometry table to verify the values.
Also, <span class="latex-for-amp">\(\tan(\frac{x}{2}) = \sqrt{\frac{1-\cos(x)}{1+\cos(x)}}\\ \\ \\ =\sqrt{\frac{(1-\cos(x))(1-\cos(x))}{(1+\cos(x))(1-\cos(x))}}\\ \\ \\ =\sqrt{\frac{(1-\cos(x))^{2}}{1-\cos^{2}(x)}}\\ \\ \\ =\sqrt{\frac{(1-\cos(x))^{2}}{\sin^{2}(x)}}\\ \\ \\ =\frac{1-\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}\)
So, <span class="latex-for-amp">\(\tan(\frac{x}{2}) =\frac{1-\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}\)

Question: Given the points (1, -2) and (-3, 5), find the distance between them.
Solution: 
Label the points as follows 
$\left(x_{1},y_{1}\right)=\left(-1,-2\right) and \left(x_{2},y_{2}\right)=\left(-3,-5\right)$
Therefore: $x_{1}=-1,\: y_{1}=-2,\: x_{2}=-3, and\: y_{2}=5$
To find the distance (<em>d</em>) between the points, use the distance formula:
$d=\sqrt{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{2}-y_{1}\right)^{2}}$
$=\sqrt{\left(-3-\left(-1\right)\right)^{2}+\left(5-\left(-2\right)\right)^{2}}
$=\sqrt{\left(-3+1\right)^{2}+\left(5+2\right)^{2}}$
$=\sqrt{\left(-2\right)^{2}+\left(7\right)^{2}}$
$\sqrt{4+49}$
$=\sqrt{53}$

In mathematics, a unit circle is a circle with a radius of one. Especially in trigonometry, the unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the Cartesian coordinate system in the Euclidean plane.
The unit circle is often denoted $S^{1}$ : the generalization to higher dimensions is the unit sphere. The interior of the unit circle is called the open unit disk while the interior of the unit circle combined with the unit circle itself is called the closed unit disk.uRLStringLine 5192" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/unit-circle-1.png" alt="unit-circle" width="391" height="217" />
The general equation of circle is given below:
\[\large \left(x-h\right)^{2}+\left(y-k\right)^{2}=r^{2}\]
Where (h, k) are center coordinates and r is the radius. 
The unit circle formula is: 
\[\large x^{2}+y^{2}=1\]
Where x and y are the coordinate values.
Question: Show that the point $P\left[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3},\,\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}\right]$ is on the unit circle.
Solution:
We need to show that this point satisfies the equation of the unit circle, that is: $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ 
$\left[\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right]^{2}+\left[\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{3}}\right]^{2}$
$=\frac{3}{9}+\frac{2}{3}$
$=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{3}$
= 1
Therefore P is on the unit circle.

In mathematics, a rate is a ratio between two related quantities as a rate of change. If the unit or quantity in respect of which something is changing is not specified, usually the rate is per unit of time.
However, a rate of change can be specified per unit of time, or per unit of length or mass or another quantity. The most common type of rate is &#8220;per unit of time&#8221;, such as speed, heart rate, and flux. Ratios that have a non-time denominator include exchange rates, literacy rates, and electric field in volts/meter.
Unit rate is a common measure used in our daily life. Where one quantity tells how much quantity in one unit. The quantity may be any thing. The rate is nothing but the ratio between two quantities. The denominator should be 1 while calculating the unit rate.

To find out the relation between two variables in a population, linear correlation is used. To see how the variables are connected we will use the formula. Also known as “Pearson’s Correlation”, linear correlation can be denoted by r” and the value will be between -1 and 1.
The elements denotes a strong relation if the product is 1. Similarly, if the coefficient comes close to -1, it has negative relation. If the Linear coefficient is zero means there is no relation between the data given. 
According to the formula we have,

By favourable outcome we mean that the outcome of interest. One should not confuse the word “favourable outcome” with desirable outcome. In some of the requirements, losing in a certain test or occurrence of an undesirable outcome can be a favourable event for the experiments run.
Now let’s see an example: What is the probability that a card taken from a deck of cards, which by the way has 52 cards, is an Ace? Since we know that the number of aces that a deck of card contains is four, the number of favourable outcome will be four. Now, by looking at the formula we come to the conclusion that the probability of finding an ace from a deck would be =
P(Ace) = 4/52
So we can say that the probability is 1/13.
When we talk about independent events then the probability of event A occurring is just as equal even if event B is occurring or not. Suppose a coin is tossed twice. The probability if the head is coming up on the second toss is ½ even if head came in the first toss. These events are independent. It is the same way when we say “It will rain tomorrow in Delhi” and “It will rain tomorrow in Mumbai” since these two events are not related. We call these events independent because it is possible that it might rain in Delhi when it is not raining in Mumbai.
In formulas, representing the probability of independent individual event happening is &#8211;
So, In our coin example above, the probability that heads with come up both time is :

Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most fundamental theorems in mathematics and it defines the relationship between the three sides of a right angled triangle. You are already aware of the definition and properties of a right angled triangle. It is the triangle with one of its angles as a right angle, that is, 90 degrees. The side that is opposite to the 90 degree angle is known as the hypotenuse. The other two sides that are adjacent to the right angle are called legs of the triangle. 
The theorem, also known as the Pythagorean theorem, states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the lengths of other two sides of the right-angled triangle. Or, the sum of the squares of the two legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of its hypotenuse. 
Let us call one of the legs on which the triangle rests as its base. The side opposite to the right angle is its hypotenuse, as we already know. The remaining side is called the perpendicular. So, mathematically, we represent the Pythagoras theorem as:
\(Hypotenuse^{2}=Perpendicular^{2}+Base^{2}\)
uRLStringLine 6796" title="Pythagorean Theorem" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20142718/Pythagorean-Theorem.png" alt="Pythagorean Theorem" width="273" height="257" />Derivation:
Consider a right angled triangle\Delta ABC. It is right angled at B.
uRLStringLine 6798" title="right angled triangle" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20142743/right-angled-triangle1.png" alt="Pythagorean Theorem" width="193" height="221" />Let BD be perpendicular to the side AC.
uRLStringLine 6799" title="right angled triangle AC" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20142812/right-angled-triangle-AC.png" alt="Pythagorean Theorem" width="193" height="221" />In   \Delta ABC and \Delta ADB 
\(\angle ABC=\angle ABD = 90^{\circ}\)  
\(\angle DBA =\angle BCA\)
\(\angle A =\angle A\)
Considering \(\Delta ABC and \Delta BDC\)
                                                   \(\angle DAB =\angle CBD\)
\(\angle DBA =\angle BCD\)
  \(\angle CDB=\angle ADB=90^{\circ}\)
Using the AA criterion for the similarity of triangles, \(\Delta BDC\cong \Delta ABC\)
Thus, it can be concluded \(\Delta ADB\cong \Delta BDC\)   
So if a perpendicular is drawn from the right-angled vertex of a right triangle to the hypotenuse, then the triangles formed on both sides of the perpendicular are similar to each other and also to the whole triangle. 

Now, we are required to prove  \(AC^{2}=AB^{2}+BC^{2}\). We drop a perpendicular BD on the side AC.
We already know that \(\Delta ADB\cong \Delta ABC\)
uRLStringLine 6800" title="right angled triangle AC 1" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20142923/right-angled-triangle-AC-1.png" alt="Pythagorean Theorem" width="179" height="193" />∴   \(\frac{AD}{AB}=\frac{AB}{BC}\) (Condition for similarity) Or \(AB^{2}=AC\times AD\)…….. (1)


Summing equation (1) with equation (2),

 \(AB^{2}+BC^{2}=CD.AC+AD.AC\) 
Hence, the proof of the Pythagoras theorem.
Solved Examples:
Question 1: Find the hypotenuse of a triangle whose lengths of two sides are 4 cm and 10cm.
Solution: Using the Pythagoras theorem,
\(Hypotenuse^{2}=Perpendicular^{2}+Base^{2}\)
\(Hypotenuse^{2}=10^{2}+4^{2}\)
\(Hypotenuse=\sqrt{10^{2}+4^{2}}=\sqrt{116}=10.77cm\)
Hence the hypotenuse of the triangle is 10.77 cm.
Question 2: If the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is 13 cm and one of the two sides is 5 cm, find the third side.
Solution: Given,
Hypotenuse a= 13 cm
One side b = 5 cm
Other side c=?
Using the Pythagoras theorem,
\(a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}\)
\(13^{2}=5^{2}+C^{2}\)
\(C^{2}=\sqrt{13^{2}-5^{2}}=\sqrt{169-25}=\sqrt{144}=12cm\)
Hence the hypotenuse of the triangle is 12cm.

In mathematics, and more specifically in numerical analysis, the trapezoidal rule, also known as the trapezoid rule or trapezium rule, is a technique for approximating the definite integral.
The trapezoidal rule works by approximating the region under the graph of the function <em>f(x)</em> as a trapezoid and calculating its area. 
The trapezoidal rule is to find the exact value of a definite integral using a numerical method. This rule is mainly based on the Newton-Cotes formula which states that one can find the exact value of the integral as an nth order polynomial.
When <em>n = 1</em> according to Trapezoidal rule, the area under the linear polynomial is stated as,
\[\large \int_{a}^{b}f\left ( x \right )dx=\left ( b-a \right )\left [ \frac{f\left ( a \right )+f\left ( b \right )}{2} \right ]\]
Example 1: Use the trapezoidal rule with <em>n = 8</em> to estimate:
$\int_{1}^{5}\sqrt{1+x^{2}}dx$
Solution:
Given,
For <em>n=8</em>, we have, $\Delta x=\frac{5-1}{8}=0.5$ we compute the values of $y_{0}$, $y_{1}$, $y_{2}$, . . . , $y_{8}$.

There may be a slight manufacturing error in measuring instruments. They can never be assumed to be exact. To get to know to what extend error is there, we go for this percent error formula.
It is the absolute value of the difference of the measured value and the actual value divided by the actual value and multiplied by 100.
Percent Error Formula is
\[\large Percentage\;Error=\frac{Approximate\;Value-Exact\;Value}{Exact\;Value}\times 100\]
Question 1: A scale measures wrongly a value as 8 cm due to some marginal errors. Calculate the percentage error if the actual measurement of the value is 12 cm.
Solution:
Given,
Percentage Error = <span class="content_latex">$\frac{Approximate Value &#8211; Exact Value}{Exact Value}$ $\times$ 100
$Percentage\;Error=\frac{8-12}{12}\times 100$

A triangle is a polygon with three edges and three vertices. It is one of the basic shapes in geometry. A triangle with vertices A, B, and C.The length of the sides of a triangle may be same or different. If all the 3 sides of a triangle are equal then it is an equilateral triangle. If 2 sides of a triangle are equal, it is an isosceles triangle.

\[Area\; of \; a\; triangle= \frac{1}{2}bh\]
Where,
If only 2 sides and an internal angle is given then the remaining sides and angles can be calculated using the below formula:
\[\large \frac{a}{sinA}=\frac{b}{sinB}=\frac{c}{sinC}\]
Example: Given the following information: c = 8, b = 12, C = 30o

Note that we are given two side lengths and an angle which is not the included angle. Referring back to the special cases described in the Introduction you will see that with this information there is the possibility that we can obtain two distinct triangles with this information. 
As before we need a sketch in order to understand the information.
uRLStringLine 5393" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Triangle-Formula-Example.png" alt="Triangle Formula Example" width="247" height="171" />
The above diagram we are given two sides and a non-included angle. Because we have been given two sides and a non-included angle we use the sine formulae. 
$\frac{a}{sinA}=\frac{b}{sinB}=\frac{c}{sinC}$
Or
$\frac{sinA}{a}=\frac{sinB}{b}=\frac{sinC}{c}$
Because we are given b, c and C we use the following part of the formula in order to find angle B.
$\frac{sinB}{b}=\frac{sinC}{c}$
$\frac{sinB}{12}=\frac{sin\, 30^{\circ}}{8}$
$sin\,B=\frac{12\times sin\, 30^{\circ}}{8}$
$=\frac{12\times \frac{1}{2}}{8}$
$=\frac{6}{8}$
$=\frac{3}{4}$
=0.75
$B=sin^{-1}\; 0.75$
= $48.6^{\circ}$ (1 d.p.)
Now there is a potential complication here because there is another angle with sine equal to 0.75. Specifically, B would equal $180^{\circ}$ − $48.6^{\circ}$ = $131.4^{\circ}$.
In the first case the angles of the triangle are then: 
C = $30^{\circ}$, B = $48.6^{\circ}$,  A = $180^{\circ}$ − $78.6^{\circ}$ = $101.4^{\circ}$
In the second case we have: 
C = $30^{\circ}$,  B = $131.4^{\circ}$,  A = $180^{\circ}$ − $161.4^{\circ}$ = $18.6^{\circ}$.
The situation is depicted in the the figure below. In order to solve the triangle completely we must deal with the two cases separately in order to find the remaining unknown a.
Case 1. Here C = $30^{\circ}$, B = $48.6^{\circ}$, A = $101.4^{\circ}$. We use the sine rule in the form
$\frac{a}{sin\, A}=\frac{b}{sin\, B}$
from which 
$a=\frac{12sin\, 101.4^{\circ}}{sin\,48.6^{\circ}}$
= 15.7 (1 d.p.)
Case 2. Here C = $30^{\circ}$, B = $131.4^{\circ}$, A = $18.6^{\circ}$. Again we can use the sine rule in the form
$\frac{a}{sin\, A}=\frac{b}{sin\, B}$
from which
$a=\frac{12sin\, 18.6^{\circ}}{sin\,131.4^{\circ}}$
= 5.1 (1 d.p.)

It can either be positive or negative, irrespective of signs. To calculate the skewness, we have to first find the mean and variance of the given data.
The formula is:

Where,
Question. Find the skewness in the following data.  

To know how skewed these data are as compared to other data sets, we have to  compute the skewness.
Sample size and sample mean should be found out.
N = 5 + 18 + 42 + 27 + 8 = 100
$\overline{x}=\frac{\left(61\times 5\right)+\left(64\times 18\right)+\left(67\times 43\right)+\left(70\times 27\right)+\left(73\times 8\right)}{100}$
$\overline{x}=\frac{6745}{100}=67.45$
Now with the mean we can compute the skewness.

Now, the skewness is 
$g_{i}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x-x_{i}\right)^{3}}{\left(n-1 \right)s^{3}}}=-\frac{2.6937}{8.5275^{\frac{3}{2}}}=-0.1082$

Statistical error arising out of nature of sampling, is known as sampling error. The error in statistical analysis arise because of unrepresentativeness of the observation in the samples taken.
For example, the weight of two thousand citizens from a country of two million is taken and the average weight is taken out from that, then it&#8217;s not the same as the average weight of the two million people in the country. 
Since to determine the characteristics of a whole population the sampling is done, the difference between the sample values and population is called sampling error. We should note that the exact value of sampling cannot be done since the population value if not known  although often sampling error can be found out by probabilistic modelling of sample.
Thus the sampling error formula is given by
\[\large Sampling\;Error=\pm \sqrt{\frac{2500}{Sample\;Size}}\times 1.96\]

In geometry, a tangent of a circle is a straight line that touches the circle at exactly one point, never entering the circle&#8217;s interior. It is a line through a pair of infinitely close points on the circle.
The tangent lines to circles form the subject of several theorems and play an important role in many geometrical constructions and proofs. Since the tangent line to a circle at a point <em>P</em> is perpendicular to the radius to that point, theorems involving tangent lines often involve radial lines and orthogonal circles.
The tangent has two defining properties such as:
The equation of the tangent is written as,
Tangents to two circles
Given two circles, there are lines that are tangents to both of them at the same time. If the circles are separate (do not intersect), there are four possible common tangents:
Two external tangents

Question: Determine the equation of the tangent to the circle: 
$x^{2}+y^{2}-2y+6x-7=0\;at\;the\;point\;F(-2:5)$
Solution:
Write the equation of the circle in the form: $\left(x-a\right)^{2}+\left(y-b\right)^{2}+r^{2}$ 
Use the method of completing the square:
$x^{2}+y^{2}-2y+6x-7=0$
$x^{2}+6x+y^{2}-2y=7$
$\left(x^{2}+6x+9\right)-9+\left(y^{2}-2y+1\right)-1=7$

Determine the gradient of the radius CF
$m_{CF}=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$
$=\frac{5-1}{-2+3}=4$
Determine the gradient of the tangent
Let the gradient of the tangent line be <i>m</i>.
$m_{CF}\times m=-1$
$4\times m=-1$
$\therefore m=-\frac{1}{4}$
Determine the equation of the tangent to the circle
Write down the gradient-point form of a straight line equation and substitute $m=-\frac{1}{4}\;and\;F(-2:5)$ 
So,
$y-y_{1}=m\left(x-x_{1}\right)$
$y-y_{1}=-\frac{1}{4}\left(x-x_{1}\right)$
$Substitute\;F\left(-2:5\right):\;y-5=-\frac{1}{4}\left(x-\left(-2\right)\right)$
$y-5=-\frac{1}{4}\left (x+2 \right )$
$y=-\frac{1}{4}x-\frac{1}{2}+5$
$=-\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{9}{2}$
The final answer
The equation of the tangent to the circle at $F\;is\;y=-\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{9}{2}$

In calculus, u-substitution,is also known as integration by substitution, is a method for finding integrals. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus often requires finding an antiderivative. For this and other reasons, integration by substitution is an important tool in mathematics. It is the counterpart to the chain rule of differentiation.
This method is intimately related to the chain rule for differentiation. In this method, the function is replaced by U and then integrate according to the fundamental integration formula after integration substitute the real function instead of U.
U substitution formula is given below,
\[\large \int f\left(g\left(x\right)\right){g}&#8217;\left(x\right)dx=\int f\left(u\right)du\]

Question: Evaluate the following integrals: $\int \left(1-\frac{1}{w}\right)cos\left(w-1nw\right)dw$ 
Solution
In this case we know how to integrate just a cosine so let’s make the substitution the stuff that is inside the cosine.
<em>u = w = 1nw</em>
$du=\left(1-\frac{1}{w}\right)dw$
So, as with the first example we worked the stuff in front of the cosine appears exactly in the differential.  The integral is then,
$=\int cos\left(u\right)du$
$=sin\left(u\right)+c$
$=sin\left(w-1nw\right)+c$

In probability theory and statistics, variance measures how far a set of numbers are spread out. It is a numerical value used to indicate how widely individuals in a group vary. If individual observations vary considerably from the group mean, the variance is big; and vice versa.
A variance of zero indicates that all the values are identical. Variance is always non-negative: a small variance indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean and hence to each other while a high variance indicates that the data points are very spread out around the mean and from each other.
The variance of a population is denoted by $\sigma^{2}$ and the variance of a sample by $s^{2}$ .
The variance of a population is defined by the following formula:
The variance of a sample is defined by slightly different formula:

Question: Find the variance for the following set of data representing trees heights in feet: 3, 21, 98, 203, 17, 9
Solution:
Step 1: Add up the numbers in your given data set.
3 + 21 + 98 + 203 + 17 + 9 = 351
Step 2: Square your answer:
351 × 351 = 123201
…and divide by the number of items. We have 6 items in our example so:
$\large \frac{123201}{6}$ =20533.5
Step 3: Take your set of original numbers from Step 1, and square them individually this time:
3 × 3 + 21 × 21 + 98 × 98 + 203 × 203 + 17 × 17 + 9 × 9
Add the squares together:
9 + 441 + 9604 + 41209 + 289 + 81 = 51,633
Step 4: Subtract the amount in Step 2 from the amount in Step 3.
51633 – 20533.5 = 31,099.5
Set this number aside for a moment.
Step 5: Subtract 1 from the number of items in your data set. For our example:
6 – 1 = 5
Step 6: Divide the number in Step 4 by the number in Step 5. This gives you the variance:
$\large \frac{31099.5}{5}$ = 6219.9
Step 7: Take the square root of your answer from Step 6. This gives you the standard deviation:
$\large \sqrt{6219.9}$ = 78.86634

A cylinder is a 3D structure that has two circular faces which are joined by a curved surface. A cylinder can be viewed as stacks of circular discs which are placed on one another. The total surface area of a cylinder can be calculated by summing up the areas of all its faces.  Volume of a cylinder is its capacity. It is the amount of space occupied by it. Mathematically, we can express it as:
uRLStringLine 6764" title="Volume of Cylinder Formula" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20114636/Volume-of-Cylinder-Formula.png" alt="Volume of Cylinder Formula" width="304" height="158" />
Where r refers to the base radius and h is the height of the cylinder.
Derivation:
As we mentioned, a cylinder is nothing but a set of circular discs stacked one upon the other. So if we compute the space occupied by each of these discs and add them up, what we get is the volume of the cylinder.
Let us say that the circular discs are stacked up to the height of ‘h’. Now, the volume of cylinder will be the product of the base area of the discs and the height ‘h’.
uRLStringLine 6765" title="circular discs" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/formulas/2016/04/20114658/circular-discs.png" alt="Volume of Cylinder Formula" width="244" height="161" />Volume of the cylinder = Area of the circular base × Height
Area of the circular base = \(\pi r^{2}\)
Thus, volume of a cylinder of height ‘h’ and base radius ‘r’ can be given as \(\pi r^{2}\times h\)
Volume of a Cylinder Formula in Real Life:
In our daily routine, we come across different types of situations where we have to handle cylindrical objects. The volume of cylinder formula is useful in calculating the capacity or volume of such cylindrical objects. This calculation can also help in designing cylindrical containers of larger or smaller volume as per the need. For example, the designing of water tanks, perfume bottles, cylindrical containers, cylindrical flasks you use in chemistry labs, etc.  You can easily find out the volume of a cylinder if you have the measurements of its height and radius.
Solved Examples:
Question 1: The volume and height of a cylindrical container are 440 m3 and 35m respectively. Calculate its radius of the base. (Take \(\pi =\frac{22}{7}\))
Solution: Given,
Volume of the cylindrical container = 440 m³
Height of the cylindrical container = 35 m
\(Volume\; of\; a\; cylinder =\pi r^{2}h\)
Or 440 m³= \(\pi r^{2}h\)
=&gt;\(r^{2}=\frac{440}{\pi h}=\frac{440\times 7}{22\times 35}\)
=&gt; r² = 4m
=&gt; r = 2 m
The radius of the base of the cylindrical container is 2 m.
Question 2: How many litres of water can a cylindrical water tank with base radius 20 cm and height 28 cm hold?
Solution: Given,
Base radius of the cylindrical water tank, r = 20 cm
Height of the cylindrical water tank, h = 28 cm
Volume of the cylindrical water tank = \(\pi r^{2}h\)
Volume of the cylindrical water tank = \(\frac{22}{7}\times 20^{2}\times 28=35200\; cm^{3}\)
1 cubic centimeter = 0.001 litre =\(1\times 10^{-3}\) litre
∴ 35200 cubic centimeter = \(35200\times 10^{-3}\) = 35.2 litres
The cylindrical water tank can hold 35.2 litres of water.

\[\large Weighted\;Average=\frac{Sum\;of\;Weighted\;Terms}{Total\;Number\;of\;Terms}\]
To find the weighted term, multiply each term by its weighting factor, which is the number of times each term occurs.
Example: A class of 25 students took a science test. 10 students had an average score of 80. The other students had an average score of 60. What is the average score of the whole class?
Solution:
Step 1: To get the sum of weighted terms, multiply each average by the number of students that had that average and then sum them up.
80 × 10 + 60 × 15 = 800 + 900 = 1700
Step 2: Total number of terms = Total number of students = 25
Step 3: Using the formula
$Weighted\;Average=\frac{Sum\;of\;Weighted\;Terms}{Total\;Number\;of\;Terms}$
Answer: The average score of the whole class is 68.

The z-score is 0.67 (to 2 decimal places), but now we need to work out the percentage (or number) of students that scored higher and lower than Ram.
Question 2: A student wrote 2 quizzes. In first quiz, he scored 80 and in other, he scored 75. The mean and standard deviation of first quiz are70 and 15 respectively, while the mean and standard deviation of second quiz are 54 and 12 respectively. The results follow normal distribution. What can you conclude about the student&#8217;s result by seeing their z scores?
Solution:
Calculation of student&#8217;s Z score for first quiz:
Population standard deviation = 15
$\large Z\; Score=\frac{x-\overline{x}}{\sigma }$
$\large =\frac{80-70}{15}$
= 0.667
Calculation of student&#8217;s Z score for second quiz:
Standardized random variable x = 75
Mean $\large \overline{x}$ = 54
Formula for Z score is given below:
$\large Z\; Score=\frac{x-\overline{x}}{\sigma }$
$\large =\frac{75-54}{12}$
= 1.75
Since Z score of second quiz is better than that of first quiz, hence it is concluded that he did better in second quiz.

The theorem can be derived as follows. Suppose $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are two continuously differentiable functions. The product rule states:
\[\large \frac{d}{dx}\left(u(x)v(x)\right)=v(x)\frac{d}{dx}(u(x))+u(x)\frac{d}{dx}(v(x))\]
Integrating both sides with respect to x,
\[\large \int \frac{d}{dx}(u(x)v(x))dx=\int u'(x)v(x)dx+\int u(x)v'(x)dx\]
then applying the definition of indefinite integral,
\[\large u(x)v(x)=\int u'(x)v(x)dx+\int u(x)v'(x)dx\]
\[\large \int u(x)v'(x)dx=u(x)v(x)-\int u'(x)v(x)dx\]
Gives the formula for integration by parts. Since $du$ and $dv$ are differentials of a function of one variable $x$,
\[\large du=u'(x)dx\;\;dv=v'(x)dx\]
\[\large \int u(x)dv=u(x)v(x)-\int v(x)du\]
The original integral $\int uv&#8217;\;dx$ contains $v&#8217;$ (derivative of $v$); in order to apply the theorem, $v$ (antiderivative of $v&#8217;$) must be found, and then the resulting integral $\int vu&#8217;\; dx$ must be evaluated.

When we compare the relationship between two numbers dealing with a kind, then we use the ratio formula. It is denoted as a separation between the number with a colon (:). Sometimes a division sign is also used to express ratios. 
For example, we are making a cake, then the recipe sometimes says to mix flour to water in the ratio 2 part 1. That means if you using 2 cups of flour then mix it with 1 cup of water. 
Both the numbers should be non-zero in order to make a meaning out of the comparison. Some ratios are denoted in percentages and decimals as well.

A quartile divides the set of observation into 4 equal parts. The middle term, between the median and first term is known as the first or Lower Quartile and is written as Q1.Similarly, the value of mid term that lies between the last term and the median is known as the third or upper quartile and is denoted as Q3.Second Quartile is the median and is written as Q2.
When the set of observation is arranged in an ascending order, then the 25th percentile is given as:
\[\large Q_{1}=\left(\frac{n+1}{4}\right)^{th}Term\]
The second quartile or the 50th percentile or the Median is given as:

\[\large Q_{3}=\left(\frac{3(n+1)}{4}\right)^{th}Term\]
\[\large IQR=Upper\;Quartile-Lower\;Quartile\]
To find the quartile we first need to arrange the values in ascending order. Then we need to put the formula to use. Let’s solve one example to make it clear to you:
Question: Find the median, lower quartile, upper quartile and inter-quartile range of the following data set of scores: 19, 21, 23, 20, 23, 27, 25, 24, 31 ?
Solution:
First, lets arrange of the values in an ascending order: 19, 20, 21, 23, 23, 24, 25, 27, 31
Now let’s calculate the Median,
$Q_{2}=\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)^{th}Term$
$Q_{2}=\left(\frac{9+1}{2}\right)^{th}Term$
$=5^{th}\;Term\; = 23$
Lower Quartile:
$Q_{1}=\left(\frac{n+1}{4}\right)^{th}Term$
$=\left(\frac{9+1}{4}\right)^{th}\;Term=2.5^{th}\;Term$
Upper Quartile:
$Q_{3}=\left(\frac{3(n+1)}{4}\right)^{th}Term$
$Q_{3}=\left(\frac{3(9+1)}{4}\right)^{th}Term$
$\frac{30}{4}=7.5^{th}\;Term$
Now find out the average between $7^{th}$ and $8^{th}$ term.
$=\frac{25+24}{2}=\frac{49}{2}= 24.5$
$IQR=Upper\;Quartile-Lower\;Quartile$
IQR = 24.5 &#8211; 11

As we mentioned, a square is nothing a rectangle with its two adjacent sides being equal in length. Hence, we express area as:
The area of a rectangle = Length × Breadth
Here, 
\(Area\; of\; square\; = a \times a = a^{2}\)

The formula for the perimeter of a square: Perimeter of the square is the length of its boundary. The sum of the length of all sides of a square represents its boundary. Hence, the formula can be given by:
Perimeter = length of 4 sides
Perimeter = a+ a + a + a 
Perimeter of square = 4a
The formula for diagonal of a square: A diagonal is a line which joins two opposite sides in a polygon. For calculating the length diagonal of a square, we make use of the Pythagoras Theorem.
In the above figure, the diagonal’ divides the square into two right angled triangles. It can be noted here that since the adjacent sides of a square are equal in length, the right angled triangle is also isosceles with each of its sides being of length ‘a’.
Hence, we can conveniently apply the Pythagorean theorem on these triangles with base and perpendicular being ‘a’ units and hypotenuse being’ units. So we have:
\(d^{2}=a^{2}+a^{2}\)
Or 
\(d=\sqrt{2a^{2}}=a\sqrt{2}\;units\)
Solved examples:
Question 1: A square has one of its sides measuring 23 cm. Calculate its area, perimeter, and length of its diagonal.
Solution: Given, 
Side of the square = 23 cm
Area of the square:
Area of the square = <i>\(a^{2}=23^{2}=529 cm^{2}\)</i>
Perimeter of the square: 
Perimeter of the square= 4a= 4 × 23 = 92 cm
Diagonal of a square: 
Diagonal of a square = \(a\sqrt{2}=23\sqrt{2\;cm}=32.52cm\)
Question 2:  A rectangular floor is 50 m long and 20 m wide. Square tiles, each of 5 m side length, are to be used to cover the floor. Find the total number of tiles which will be required to cover the floor.
Solution: Given,
Length of the floor = 50 m
Breadth = 20 m
Area of the rectangular floor = length x breadth = 50 m x 20 m = 1000 sq. m
Side of one tile = 5 m
Area of one such tile = side x side = 5 m x 5 m = 25 sq. m
\(No.\; of\; tiles\; needed = \frac{Area\; of\; floor}{Area\; of\; one\; tile}=\frac{1000}{25}=40\; tiles\)

Standard deviation is defined as, &#8220;The deviation of the values  or data from an average mean&#8221;
Standard Deviation helps us to know how the values of a particular data are dispersed. Lower standard deviation concludes that the values are very close to their average. Whereas higher values mean  the values are far from the mean value. Standard deviation value can never be in negative.

In geometry, a vertex is a point where two or more curves, lines, or edges meet. As a consequence of this definition, the point where two lines meet to form an angle and the corners of polygons and polyhedra are vertices.
For example, a square has four corners, each is called a vertex. The plural form of the vertex is vertices. The word vertex is most commonly used to denote the corners of a polygon.
When two lines meet at a vertex, they form an included angle. For polygons, the included angle at each vertex is an interior angle of the polygon. Vertex is also sometimes used to indicate the &#8216;top&#8217; or high point of something, such as the vertex of an isosceles triangle , which is the &#8216;top&#8217; corner opposite its base, but this is not its strict mathematical definition.uRLStringLine 5175" src="https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Vertex-Formula-1.png" alt="Vertex Formula" width="687" height="462" />
The Vertex Formula is given as,
\[\large Vertex=\left(h,\:k\right)=\left(\frac{-b}{2a},c-\frac{b^{2}}{4a}\right)\]
Example: Find the vertex of the parabola: $y=3x^{2}+12x-12$ 
Solution:
Given,
So, the x-coordinate of the vertex is: 
$-\frac{12}{2\left ( 3 \right )}$
Substituting in the original equation to get the y-coordinate:
$y=3\left(\overline{2}\right)+12\left(-2\right)-12$
So, the vertex of the parabola is at (-2, -24).

Statistical hypothesis testing is the a result that is attained when a p &#8211; value is lesser than the significance level, denoted by  , alpha.   p &#8211; value is the probability of getting at least as extreme results that is provided that the null hypothesis is true. Statistical significance is the mean to get sure that the statistic is reliable. 
If there is a large sample size, then small difference in the research findings can be negligible if you are very sure that the differences did not arise out of fluke. This formula helps us determine that there is a relationship in the differences or variations. Depending upon the sample size, to know how moderate, weak or strong is the relationship, statistical significance is used. 
Statistical significance is also referred to as type 1 error. The formula and terminologies related to this formula is given as:
\[\large Z=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}\]
Question:  Find out the statistical significance using the z test if the sample mean is 16,  is $\mu$ 12, σ is 4 and the sample size is 30?
Solution
Given parameters are
$\overline{x}=15$
With the formula we can say that: $ Z=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$
$Z=\frac{15-12}{\frac{5}{\sqrt{30}}}$

Where,
$x$ is the repeating value
As many of the values in this data set are repeated multiple times, you can easily compute the sample mean as a weighted mean. Follow these steps to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean: 
Step 1: Assign a weight to each value in the dataset:
$x_{1}=1,\:w_{1}=73$
Step 2: Compute the numerator of the weighted mean formula.
Multiply each sample by its weight and then add the products together:
$\sum_{i=1}^{4}w_{i}\,x_{i}=w_{1}\,x_{1}+w_{2}\,x_{2}+w_{3}\,x_{3}+w_{4}\,x_{4}$
= (1)(73)+(2)(378)+(3)(459)+(4)(90)
=2566
Step 3: Now, compute the denominator of the weighted mean formula by adding the weights together.
$\sum_{i=1}^{4}w_{i}=w_{1}+w_{2}+w_{3}+w_{4}$
= 73 + 378 + 459 + 90
=1000
Step 4: Divide the numerator by the denominator
$\large \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{4}w_{i}\,x_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{4}w_{i}}$
$=\frac{2566}{1000}$
$=2.566$
