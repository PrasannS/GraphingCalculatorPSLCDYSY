formula


Definition
!@#$%
In mathematics, a formula is a fact, rule, or principle that is expressed in terms of mathematical symbols. Examples of formulas include equations, equalities, identities, inequalities, and asymptotic expressions.
The term "formula" is also commonly used in the theory of logic to mean sentential formula (also called a propositional formula), i.e., a formula in propositional calculus.
The correct Latin plural form of formula is "formulae, " although the less pretentious-sounding "formulas" is more commonly used.

Basic definition
!@#$%
An operation * is associative if x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z for all x, y, and z.


Detailed definition
!@#$%
Three elements x, y and z of a set S are said to be associative under a binary operation * if they satisfy
x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z.
Real numbers are associative under addition
x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
and multiplication
x·(y·z) = (x·y)·z.
The Wolfram Language attribute that sets a function to be associative is Flat.

In mathematics, a formula is a fact, rule, or principle that is expressed in terms of mathematical symbols. Examples of formulas include equations, equalities, identities, inequalities, and asymptotic expressions.
The term "formula" is also commonly used in the theory of logic to mean sentential formula (also called a propositional formula), i.e., a formula in propositional calculus.
The correct Latin plural form of formula is "formulae, " although the less pretentious-sounding "formulas" is more commonly used.

Detailed definition

Covariance provides a measure of the strength of the correlation between two or more sets of random variates. The covariance for two random variates X and Y, each with sample size N, is defined by the expectation value
cov(X, Y) | = | 〈(X - μ_X)(Y - μ_Y)〉
 | = | 〈XY〉 - μ_X μ_y
where μ_x = 〈X〉 and μ_y = 〈Y〉 are the respective means, which can be written out explicitly as
cov(X, Y) = sum_(i = 1)^N ((x_i - x^_)(y_i - y^_))/N.

!@#$%
Let X_1, X_2, ..., X_N be a set of N independent random variates and each X_i have an arbitrary probability distribution P(x_1, ..., x_N) with mean μ_i and a finite variance σ_i^2. Then the normal form variate
X_norm congruent ( sum_(i = 1)^N x_i - sum_(i = 1)^N μ_i)/sqrt( sum_(i = 1)^N σ_i^2)
has a limiting cumulative distribution function which approaches a normal distribution.

covariance matrix


Definition
!@#$%
Given n sets of variates denoted {X_1}, ..., {X_n} , the first-order covariance matrix is defined by
V_(ij) = cov(x_i, x_j) congruent 〈(x_i - μ_i)(x_j - μ_j)〉, where μ_i is the mean. Higher order matrices are given by
V_(ij)^(mn) = 〈(x_i - μ_i)^m (x_j - μ_j)^n〉.
An individual matrix element V_(ij) = cov(x_i, x_j) is called the covariance of x_i and x_j.

Definition
!@#$%
A cubic equation is an equation involving a cubic polynomial, i.e., one of the form
a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0.
Since a_3 !=0 (or else the polynomial would be quadratic and not cubic), this can without loss of generality be divided through by a_3, giving
x^3 + a_2^, x^2 + a_1^, x + a_0^, = 0.
A closed-form formula known as the cubic formula exists for the solutions of a cubic equation.

formula


Definition
!@#$%
In mathematics, a formula is a fact, rule, or principle that is expressed in terms of mathematical symbols. Examples of formulas include equations, equalities, identities, inequalities, and asymptotic expressions.
The term "formula" is also commonly used in the theory of logic to mean sentential formula (also called a propositional formula), i.e., a formula in propositional calculus.
The correct Latin plural form of formula is "formulae, " although the less pretentious-sounding "formulas" is more commonly used.

function


Basic definition
!@#$%
A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. The term "function" is sometimes implicitly understood to mean continuous function, linear function, or function into the complex numbers.


Detailed definition
!@#$%
A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from A to B is an object f such that every a element A is uniquely associated with an object f(a) element B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation. The set A of values at which a function is defined is called its domain, while the set f(A) subset B of values that the function can produce is called its range. Here, the set B is called the codomain of f.

area hyperbolic functions | hyperbolic inverse functions


Definition
!@#$%
The inverse hyperbolic functions, sometimes also called the area hyperbolic functions are the multivalued function that are the inverse functions of the hyperbolic functions. They are denoted cosh^(-1) z, coth^(-1) z, csch^(-1) z, sech^(-1) z, sinh^(-1) z, and tanh^(-1) z. Variants of these notations beginning with a capital letter are commonly used to denote their principal values.
These functions are multivalued, and hence require branch cuts in the complex plane. Differing branch cut conventions are possible, but those adopted in this work follow those used by the Wolfram Language, summarized below.

Definition
!@#$%
The mean deviation (also called the mean absolute deviation) is the mean of the absolute deviations of a set of data about the data's mean. For a sample size N, the mean deviation is defined by
MD congruent 1/N sum_(i = 1)^N left bracketing bar x_i - x^_ right bracketing bar , where x^_ is the mean of the distribution. The mean deviation of a list of numbers is implemented in the Wolfram Language as MeanDeviation[data].
The mean deviation for a discrete distribution P_i defined for i = 1, 2, ..., N is given by
MD = sum_(i = 1)^N P_i left bracketing bar x_i - x^_ right bracketing bar .

per cent | percentage


Definition
!@#$%
The use of percentages is a way of expressing ratios in terms of whole numbers. A ratio or fraction is converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100 and appending a "percentage sign" %. For example, if an investment grows from P = 13. to A = 22.5, then A is 22.5/13. = 1.7308 times as much as P, i.e., 173.08% of P. So it is also true that the investment has grown by 173.08% - 100% = 73.08%. A change of a certain percent n is sometimes said to be a change of percentage points.

A square root of x is a number r such that r*r = x.


Detailed definition
!@#$%
A square root of x is a number r such that r^2 = x. When written in the form x^(1/2) or especially sqrt(x), the square root of x may also be called the radical or surd. The square root is therefore an nth root with n = 2.

formula


Definition
!@#$%
In mathematics, a formula is a fact, rule, or principle that is expressed in terms of mathematical symbols. Examples of formulas include equations, equalities, identities, inequalities, and asymptotic expressions.
The term "formula" is also commonly used in the theory of logic to mean sentential formula (also called a propositional formula), i.e., a formula in propositional calculus.
The correct Latin plural form of formula is "formulae, " although the less pretentious-sounding "formulas" is more commonly used.

distributive


Alternate name
!@#$%
distributive property


Basic definition
!@#$%
An operation * is distributive if has the property in multiplication that x*(y + z) = x*y + x*z.


Detailed definition
!@#$%
A multiplication * is said to be right distributive if
(x + y) z = xz + yz
for every x, y, and z. Similarly, it is said to be left distributive if
z(x + y) = zx + zy
for every x, y, and z.
If a multiplication is both right- and left-distributive, it is simply said to be distributive. For example, the real numbers R are distributive.

sampling


Definition
!@#$%
In statistics, sampling is the selection and implementation of statistical observations in order to estimate properties of an underlying population. Sampling is a vital part of modern polling, market research, and manufacturing, and its proper use is vital in the functioning of modern economies. The portion of a population selected for analysis is known as a sample, and the number of members in the sample is called the sample size.
The term "sampling" is also used in signal processing to refer to measurement of a signal at discrete times, usually with the intension of reconstructing the original signal.

Definition
!@#$%
A linear equation is an algebraic equation of the form
y = mx + b
involving only a constant and a first-order (linear) term, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. The above form is aptly known as slope-intercept form; alternatively, linear equations can be written in a number of other forms including standard form, intercept form, etc.

mean absolute deviation


Definition
!@#$%
The mean deviation (also called the mean absolute deviation) is the mean of the absolute deviations of a set of data about the data's mean. For a sample size N, the mean deviation is defined by
MD congruent 1/N sum_(i = 1)^N left bracketing bar x_i - x^_ right bracketing bar , where x^_ is the mean of the distribution. The mean deviation of a list of numbers is implemented in the Wolfram Language as MeanDeviation[data].
The mean deviation for a discrete distribution P_i defined for i = 1, 2, ..., N is given by
MD = sum_(i = 1)^N P_i left bracketing bar x_i - x^_ right bracketing bar .

prime formulas


Definition
!@#$%
There exist a variety of formulas for either producing the nth prime as a function of n or taking on only prime values. However, all such formulas require either extremely accurate knowledge of some unknown constant, or effectively require knowledge of the primes ahead of time in order to use the formula. There also exist simple prime-generating polynomials that generate only primes for the first (possibly large) number of integer values.
There are also many beautiful formulas involving prime sums and prime products that can be done in closed form.

right angle

!@#$%



Basic definition
!@#$%
A right angle is an angle that measures exactly 90 degrees.


Detailed definition
!@#$%
A right angle is an angle equal to half the angle from one end of a line segment to the other. A right angle is π/2 radians or 90°. A triangle containing a right angle is called a right triangle. However, a triangle cannot contain more than one right angle, since the sum of the two right angles plus the third angle would exceed the 180° total possessed by a triangle.
The patterns of cracks observed in mud that has been dried by the sun form curves that often intersect in right angles.
