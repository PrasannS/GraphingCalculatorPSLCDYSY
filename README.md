Hello guys, I'll put any general info, advice, and research on this page, feel free to do so as well. When we come up with an idea for this first project I'll create and upload a basic app package and we can kick off from there. Please feel free to write any thoughts or comments on this document. Also please add any ideas in the list below.

IDEAS:

Think about something towards the practical side. Something that has a real world usage, and don't be afraid to put in any ridiculous ideas, Lucas accidentally made some half decent ideas while joking. I don't want to take too much time on this so please, put in as much as you can ASAP.

Alarm Clock App where you have to solve a problem or do something that requires thinking in order to shut off the alarm so that you dont immediately go back to sleep. Similar to Mathe Alarm Clock but different.

App to check if particular item can be recycled

Pomodoro App
