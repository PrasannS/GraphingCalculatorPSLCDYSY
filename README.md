Hello guys, I'll put any general info, advice, and research on this page, feel free to do so as well. When we come up with an idea for this first project I'll create and upload a basic app package and we can kick off from there. Please feel free to write any thoughts or comments on this document. Also please add any ideas in the list below.

IDEAS:

Think about something towards the practical side. Something that has a real world usage, and don't be afraid to put in any ridiculous ideas, Lucas accidentally made some half decent ideas while joking. I don't want to take too much time on this so please, put in as much as you can ASAP.

Alarm Clock App where you have to solve a problem or do something that requires thinking in order to shut off the alarm so that you dont immediately go back to sleep. Similar to Mathe Alarm Clock but different.

OK so I've talked a bit and I guess the final concencus has gone into doing a graphing calculator... so that's what we're doing. Here is what I would I would like to be done this week:

Daniel: Since you are not in the compsci 2 class and I don't know the minimal amount of knowledge you have your task is a bit simpler than the rest. I would like you to work on creating a decent wiki template for one mathematical concept. To do this I would recommend primarily using the xml file which can be found on the filepath app/res/layout.

Samuel: Since you are in the class your task will be a bit more challenging. I would like for you to create an interactive graph with x and y axis that we can further develop at a later date. This may take some research.

Lucas: I would like you to modify and apply the basic settings template as much as you can. It will be a bit tougher than at first seeming due to the fact that it is written in all java.

Prasann: I am going to create the calculator activity from scratch, none of the templates suit it. With this I hope to create a fully functioning scientific calculator 

IN ADDITTION TO THIS I WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO ADD A SEARCHBAR TO THE TOP OF THEIR ASSIGNED ACTIVITY AND A BUTTON THAT TAKES THE USER BACK TO THE HOME AND A BUTTON THAT TAKES THE USER TO SETTINGS.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS HERE OR ON GROUP CHAT.
